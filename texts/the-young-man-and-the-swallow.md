There was a young man, who was very popular among his friends because we was a
good spender. And he quickly wasted all his money.

One day in the early spring, he had nothing left, not even a single coin, but
his clothes.

And he had to meet a friend, but had no money to buy any new clothes. But he saw
a swallow fly by, and the young man thought that the summer arrived. And we went
to a clothes merchant and sold his clothes and bought himself new ones.

Some days later, the days suddenly became cold and frosty. And the swallow, and
the foolish man who barely had new summer clothes that did not cover his arms or
knees, shivered themselves to death.
