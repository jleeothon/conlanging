En wolf hwe had et knuk stikon in sein hals, hűred em kran gigin fil gold för at
ställiun seinat kopp in þet munþ þes wolfas und nimmon þet knuk ut. Hwan þe kran
namm þet knuk ut und fróg öbir þet försprukna gold, sagede þe wolf, hlahonda und
miþ þen tanþan samon gibiton:

"Hwarför? Has al ginóg undgäldj, för at sikor ställdes þeinat kopp in und ut
fram þe munþ und þe múl es wolfas."

Hwan at helpon þen üblan, ne wardon bilaun, und weson þankbar hwis undkwemmon
wundlaus.

---

A wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a crane, for a large sum, to put
her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the crane had extracted the
bone and demanded the promised payment, the wolf, grinning and grinding his
teeth, exclaimed:

"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been
permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf."

In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury
for your pains.

Translated by George Fyler Townsend
