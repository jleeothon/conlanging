En wolf hwe had et knuk stikon in sein hals, hűred em kran gigin fil gold för at

"Hwarför? Has al ginóg undgäldj, för at sikor ställedes þeinat kopp in und út

Hwan helpes þen üblan, ne warde-þú bilaun, und wese-þú þankbar hwef ändkwemmes

---

A wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a crane, for a large sum, to put
her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the crane had extracted the
bone and demanded the promised payment, the wolf, grinning and grinding his
teeth, exclaimed:

"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been
permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf."

In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury
for your pains.

Translated by George Fyler Townsend
