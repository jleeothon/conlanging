Was en kuning und he had nen kind. Abir þe kuning wold em sun.

He fragued an en kerkman: "Látet en sun an mih weson boron".

Þe kerkman saged an þen kuning: "Bedu an þen gud Werun".

Werun kwam niþir af himil. "Hwat willes?"

"Will en sun."

"Þus skoled." saged þe berhta gud Werun.

Und þe frauw þes kuningas bar en sun.

There was a king and he was childless. But the king wanted a son. He asked the
priest: "Let a son to me be born".

The priest said to the king: "Pray to the god Werunos".

Werunos came down from heaven. "What do you want?"

"I want a son."

"So should it be.", said the bright god Werunos.

And the king's lady bore a son.
