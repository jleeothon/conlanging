There was a king and he was childless. But the king wanted a son. He asked the
priest: "Let a son to me be born".

The priest said to the king: "Pray to the god Werunos".

Werunos came down from heaven. "What do you want?"

"I want a son."

"So should it be.", said the bright god Werunos.

And the king's lady bore a son.
