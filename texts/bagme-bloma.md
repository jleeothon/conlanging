Birkj beret berhta bógan

---

The birch bears fine leaves on shining boughs, it grows pale green and
glittering, the flower of the trees in bloom, fair-haired and supple-limbed, the
ruler of the mountain.

The winds call, they shake gently, she bends her boughs low in sport; smooth,
straight and white-barked, trembling she speaks a language, a bright token, a
good mystery, blessing my people.

Evening grows dark with clouds, the lightning flashes, the fine leaves fly free,
but firms and faithful the white birch stands bare and waits, ruling the
mountain.
