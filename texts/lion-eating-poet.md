Mr. Shi, a poet who lived in a stone house, liked to eat lions. He vowed to eat
ten lions. He often went to the market to look at lions. At ten o’clock, he went
to the market, (and) just then ten large lions (also) came to the market. At
that time, he saw these ten lions. Relying on the power of ten arrows with stone
tips, he caused the ten lions to pass away. He picked up the bodies of the ten
lions and went back to his stone house. The stone house was damp, so he told his
servant to try and wipe it (dry). After the house had been wiped (dry), he began
to try to eat the bodies of the ten lions. As he was eating, he realized that
the bodies of the ten large lions were actually bodies of ten large stone lions.
Only then did he understand the real situation. Can (you) explain what happened?
