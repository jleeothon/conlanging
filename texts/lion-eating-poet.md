Mr. Shi, a poet who lived in a stone house, liked to eat lions. He vowed to eat
ten lions. He often went to the market to look at lions. At ten o’clock, he went
to the market, (and) just then ten large lions (also) came to the market. At
that time, he saw these ten lions.

Relying on the power of ten arrows with stone tips, he caused the ten lions to
pass away. He picked up the bodies of the ten lions and went back to his stone
house.

The stone house was damp, so he told his servant to try and wipe it (dry). After
the house had been wiped (dry), he began to try to eat the bodies of the ten
lions. As he was eating, he realized that the bodies of the ten large lions were
actually bodies of ten large stone lions. Only then did he understand the real
situation.

Can (you) explain what happened?
