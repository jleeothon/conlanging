In en feld an en sumordag sang en Grashoppárj.

En meurj kwam bi, und drug et hwäitjkorn to sein nest.

"Hwaför ne kwemmes und prates miþ mih", saged þe Grashoppárj, "stadir þet werkon
dih daud?"

"Helpe samlon eton för þet wintor", saged þe meurj. "Und skoldes móton dón þet
sama."

Þe Gras-Hoppárj sagede: "Abir hebbon hjan hail filat eton."

Abir þe meurj ging þet weg þenar wiþir und werkued wiþir.

Hwan þe wintor kwam, þe Gras-Hoppárj ne had eton und bigann hungruon, hweilir at
sah at þe meurjan elkat dagin fördailden þet hwäitj af þet fórsamluon.

Und þe Gras-Hoppárj wist: is betir forraidiun för þe nauddagan.

In a field on summer day a Grasshopper was singing.

An Ant passed by, bearing with great effort a kernel of wheat to its nest.

"Why don't you come and chat with me", said the Grasshopper, "instead of working
yourself to death?"

"I am helping to gather food for the winter", said the Ant. "And you should do
the same."

The Grasshopper said: "But we have very much food now."

But the Ant went its way further and worked further.

When the winter came, the Grasshopper had no food and started to hunger, while
it saw that the ants distributed wheat every day from the reserves.

And the Grasshopper knew: it is better to prepare for the days of necessity.
