  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*mogʰus||boy}}. Cognate with
  {{cog|cel-pro|*mogus||boy, servant}}, {{cog|sga|mug}},
  {{cog|kw|maw||servant}}.<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG|*magu-}}</ref> Unrelated to
  {{ncog|cel-pro|*makʷos||son}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈmɑ.ɣuz/}}


  ===Noun===

  {{gem-noun|m}}


  # [[boy]]


  ====Inflection====

  The stem was originally *''magw-'' alternating with *''mag-'' next to *''u''
  as per the [[w:boukólos rule|boukólos rule]], but after the change *''gw'' >
  *''w'' would have had an alternation between *''mag-'' and *''maw-'' depending
  on the ending. This alternation is not preserved in any daughter language and
  presumably had been levelled in Proto-Germanic as well, but the derived noun
  still shows the second alternant.
