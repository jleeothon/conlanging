  ===Etymology===

  Uncertain. Possibly representing a substantivization of the original middle
  participle ''*-m̥h₁nós'' > ''*-m̥h₁n-yo-'', or an extension to what was
  originally an mn-stem formation. {{attention|gem-pro|There is more about this
  in the reference I added below, but I am not really great with PIE so I'm not
  sure how to interpret the comments found there - and too lazy to figure it out
  right now. I'll paste the relevant sections in the talk page.}}
