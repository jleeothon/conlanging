  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Back-formed from the plural *''Rūmōnīz'', from {{der|gem-pro|la|Rōmānī}},
  itself the plural of {{m|la|Rōmānus}}.


  At the time of borrowing, *''ō'' was still pronounced as a more open vowel
  ''ā'', probably {{IPAchar|/ɒː/}}. Since Proto-Germanic did not possess a long
  *''ō'' at that time, the closest vowel to the Latin ''ō'' was Proto-Germanic
  *''ū''. Therefore, the word was probably borrowed from Latin as *''Rūmānīz''.
  At that time, Proto-Germanic had not yet completed the full shift from ''ā''
  to ''ō'', since the shift affected this loanword as well when it did occur,
  changing *''Rūmānīz'' to *''Rūmōnīz''. This provides evidence that the shift
  occurred around or shortly after the first contact between Romans and Germanic
  tribes, which cannot have been later than the [[w:Battle of Noreia|Battle of
  Noreia]] in 112 BCE.<ref name="PIEPG" />
