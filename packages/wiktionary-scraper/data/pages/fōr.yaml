  ====Inflection====

  The original heteroclitic alternation of r/n is preserved.


  Simms posits several stages of development of this word. Since no single
  paradigm can be asserted for Proto-Germanic at any given point in time, the
  developments are detailed below.


  '''Paradigm 1:''' The original paradigm as inherited from PIE.

  {{gem-decl-noun|1}}


  '''Paradigm 2:''' An alternative paradigm was later formed based on the stem
  *''fu-'' and regular n-stem endings. The two formations coexisted side by side
  for a period.

  {{gem-decl-noun|2}}


  '''Paradigm 3:''' At a certain point in time, the two paradigms above were
  blended, attaching n-stem endings to the stem *''fun-''. Paradigm 1 was lost
  after that, paradigms 2 and 3 continued to exist side by side.

  {{gem-decl-noun|3}}


  After the above stages, paradigms 2 and 3 finally split. In paradigm 2 the
  ''-r-'' was generalised to all forms, creating *''f≈çr'', *''fu√Ør-'', which is
  found in North and West Germanic. In paradigm 3, the ''-n-'' was generalised
  to the nominative, creating *''f≈çn'', *''funin-'' as found in Gothic and in
  the Old Norse form {{m|non|funi}}.
