  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{root|gem-pro|ine-pro|*leyg-|id=like}}

  From {{m|gem-pro|*-līkaz}}.


  ===Verb===

  {{gem-verb}}


  # to [[conform]], to be of an agreeable kind

  # to [[please]] (+ {{glossary|dative case|dative}} {{glossary|object}}), to
  [[like]] ({{glossary|impersonal}}) (+ {{glossary|dative case|dative}}
  {{glossary|subject}})

  #: {{ux|gem-pro|*Ne wait hwat sagaisi, ak miz '''līkaiþi'''.|I don't know what
  you're saying, but I '''like''' it.}}


  ====Usage notes====

  Judging from Gothic evidence, the difference between this verb and the derived
  verb {{m|gem-pro|*galīkāną}} seems to have only been one of transitivity. The
  former could take an object in the dative, while the latter was intransitive
  only. Other than that the meanings were pretty much identical.
