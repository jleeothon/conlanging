  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Borrowed, as one of the earliest loanwords in Germanic, from
  {{bor|gem-pro|la|vīnum}}.<ref name="Page">B. Richard Page, in ''Studies in
  Classical Linguistics in Honor of Philip Baldi'' (2010, ed. by Page and Aaron
  Rubin), pages 75-76: "Latin ''vinum'' 'wine' is one of the earliest loanwords
  in Germanic. It is attested throughout Germanic: Go. ''wein'', ON ''vin''
  ''vín'', OE ''wīn'', OHG ''wīn'', OS ''wīn''. Jellinek (1926: 184-185) argues
  that the loan occurred no later than the first century CE since the Germanic
  forms reflect a phonetic glide for initial Latin (v). Latin texts in the first
  century CE often confuse (b) with etymologically expected (v), indicating
  spirantization of the glide. Additional support is found in the orthographic
  treatment of Latin (v) in later Latin loanwords. Compare Go. ''wein'' with Go.
  ''naúbaímbaír'' 'November' (Green 1998: 207). Further phonological evidence
  for the early date of the loan is the loss of the final ''-o'' < ''-um'' in
  Latin ''vinum'' via the Germanic Auslautgesetze (Jellinek 1926: 185, Green
  1998: 207). Green (1998: 127-129) surveys extralinguistic evidence that
  indicates the Germani were acquainted with wine, and presumably the word
  ''vinum'', by the first century BCE. A large number of Roman wine sets have
  been discovered throughout Germanic territories in Northern Europe,..."</ref>
