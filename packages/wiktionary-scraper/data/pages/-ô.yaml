  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ɔːː/}}


  ===Etymology 1===

  {{unk|gem-pro|Uncertain}}. Possibly a fossilised form of the
  Proto-Indo-European thematic ablative *''-eh₂d'', in which case it would
  reflect earlier *''-ôt'' before word-final ''-t'' was lost.


  ====Adverb====

  {{gem-adv}}


  # {{senseid|gem-pro|adverb}} [[-ly]]. {{non-gloss definition|Creates adverbs
  of manner from adjectives.}}


  =====Derived terms=====

  {{suffixsee|gem-pro|id=adverb}}


  =====Related terms=====

  * {{l|gem-pro|*-ê}}


  =====Descendants=====

  This suffix lost its function in some Middle {{cog|gmw}} languages, where
  adverbs eventually became identical to the base adjectives they were formed
  from.

  ===Etymology 2===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-ō|*-ō(n)}}.

  [[w:Proto-Indo-European_nominals#Athematic_accent/ablaut_classes|Proto-Indo-European
  amphikinetic]] n-stems, meaning the [[w:Indo-European_ablaut|vowel grade]] in
  the root, the suffix{{,}} and  the ending alternated throughout the paradigm.
  Stem ablaut was not preserved in any later Germanic language, but it is
  indirectly tangible through such pairs as English {{m|en|corn}} and German
  {{m|de|Kern||seed}}. Suffix ablaut is clearly visible in the paradigm below,
  by way of the *ô ~ *a ~ *i alternation.<ref>{{cite-book|author=Guus
