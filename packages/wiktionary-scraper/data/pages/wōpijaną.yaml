  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*weh₂b-||to call, shout, complain}}. Cognate with
  {{cog|sla-pro|*vabiti||to lure}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈwɔː.pi.jɑ.nɑ̃/}}


  ===Verb===

  {{gem-verb}}


  # to [[cry out]], to [[lament]]


  ====Inflection====

  The evolution of this verb's conjugation is unusual and controversial. Unlike
  usual expectations, it is weak in Gothic and strong class 7 with a
  reduplicated preterite in Old English. Orel and Ringe disagree on how this
  situation arose.

  * Orel believes that there were two separate, but related homophonous verbs in
  Proto-Germanic, with the weak verb being the {{m|gem-pro|*-janą}} derivative
  of the strong one.

  * Ringe believes that independently, Old Norse and Gothic made the strong verb
  weak due to analogy.

  * Kroonen makes no comment about this verb's paradigm, and in fact the verb is
  not mentioned at all in his ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic''.
