  {{reconstructed}}

  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Alternative forms===

  * {{alt|gem-pro|*-ingō|*-engō}}


  ===Etymology===

  {{unk|gem-pro}}, but possibly from an earlier ''*-ōngō'', equivalent to
  {{af|gem-pro|*-ōną|*-gō}}. No certain cognates outside of Germanic and not
  found in Gothic, which has instead similar verbal nouns without -g-.

  Perhaps cognate with Latin suffixes {{m|la|-undus}} {{q|forms the gerund}} or
  from {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-n̥kʷos}} as in {{m|grc|ἀλλοδαπός}},
  {{m|grc|ποδαπός}}, and possibly {{m|la|propinquus}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/uŋ.ɡɔː/}}


  ===Suffix===

  {{gem-noun|f}}


  # [[-ing]], [[-ion]]. ''Forms gerund nouns from verbs.''


  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-decl-noun}}


  ====Usage notes====

  * ''*-ungō'' was originally used with weak class 2 verbs (verbs ending in
  {{m|gem-pro|*-ōną}}) and ''*-ingō'' was used with weak class 1 verbs (verbs
  ending in {{m|gem-pro|*-janą}}) which eventually extended to all other verbs,
  possibly absorbing other verbal suffixes in the process (e.g. ''*-āngō'',
  ''*-angō'', ''*-engō'', etc.). Over time, the distinction between ''*-ungō''
  and ''*-ingō'' in the daughter languages became blurred and the suffixes were
  eventually merged in modern times.
