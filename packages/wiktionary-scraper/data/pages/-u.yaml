  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Possibly from Pre-Germanic {{m|gem-pro||*-we}}, from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-wƒì}}, which would make it cognate to {{cog|la|-ve}},
  {{cog|grc|·º§}}, {{cog|txb|wa}} and {{cog|sa|‡§µ‡§æ}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  *{{IPA|gem-pro|/u/}}


  ===Particle===

  {{gem-particle}}


  # {{n-g|Added to the end of a word in a phrase (usually the first word) to
  make it a question.}}


  ====Usage notes====

  This suffix was used when asking yes/no questions or, based on Gothic usage,
  to present a binary choice between two options. It was attached to the first
  word in a clause. If the first word was a compound or had a prefix, this
  suffix was infixed after the first part of a compound or after the prefix,
  effectively splitting the word in two.
