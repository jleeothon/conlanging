  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Usually held to be a borrowing from {{bor|gem-pro|la|-ārius}}; at the very
  least, it was probably influenced and reinforced by it.


  However, Gąsiorowski instead suggests that ''*-ārijaz'' is a native formation;
  he derives it from earlier ''*-azrijaz'', which he etymologises as a
  zero-grade form of {{m|ine-pro|*-sōr}} suffixed with {{m|ine-pro|*-ih₂}},
  creating a suffix ''*-sr-ih₂'' for forming feminine agent nouns, which were
  then masculinised by attaching {{m|ine-pro|*-ós}}. He also suggests a relation
  to {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*-astrijā}}.<ref>{{cite-journal|author=Piotr
