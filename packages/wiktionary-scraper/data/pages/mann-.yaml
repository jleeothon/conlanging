  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*mon-}} or {{m|ine-pro|*men-}}. Alternatively,
  Kroonen favors the word splitting off from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*ǵʰmṓ|*(dʰ)ǵʰmō, *(dʰ)ǵʰmon-}} in the cases where the
  -m- wasn't syllabic (which otherwise gave {{m|gem-pro||*gum-}}, see
  {{m|gem-pro|*gumô}}), the initial cluster would have been unpronounceable in
  Germanic, giving a reduced {{m|gem-pro||*(-)man-}}.<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG}}</ref>


  ===Noun===

  {{gem-noun|m}}


  # [[human]], [[human being]], [[person]], [[individual]]

  # [[man]]

  # {{lb|gem-pro|Runic alphabet}} name of the M-rune ([[ᛗ]])


  ====Inflection====

  This noun was inflected as a consonant stem, but the daughter languages
  disagree on the form of the nominative singular. The Gothic form points to a
  nominative *''man(n)ô'', as does the rare {{cog|ang|-}} nominative
  {{m|ang|manna}}. The north and west Germanic forms, on the other hand,
  indicate *''mannz''. Judging from Gothic evidence, the original compounding
  form was *''mana(n)-'' with only a single -''n''-, as in
  {{m|got|𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌰𐍃𐌴𐌸𐍃|t=mankind}}; however, note also
  {{m|got|𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌻𐌴𐌹𐌺𐌰|t=portrait}}.


  Several ideas have been proposed to explain the unusual morphology of this
  word, particularly the geminate -''nn''-. One proposal is that its stem was
  ''manwa-'' (wa-stem) or ''manu-'' (u-stem), where -''nw''- would have become
  -''nn''- through regular sound change in Germanic. This explains the
  relationship of the noun to cognates elsewhere in Indo-European, but crucially
  it does not explain the consonant stem inflection.


  A more recent proposal is that the noun reflects a root ''man-'' to which
  n-stem endings have been added. These n-stem endings were not the usual type
  found in Germanic, but a rarer type that lacked a vowel between the root and
  the stem suffix in some of the forms. This is also seen in {{m|gem-pro|*uhsô}}
  (which has the stem *''uhsn-'' in the plural), {{m|gem-pro|*arô}} (with
  ''*arn-''), {{m|gem-pro|*berô}} (with ''*bern-'') and {{cog|la|carō}} (with
  ''carn-''). The stem without a vowel would have then been *''man-n-'', to
  which consonant stem endings would have been added, as n-stems were consonant
  stems in origin. If this is the case, it would explain the geminate -''nn''-,
  the consonant stem endings, and would also account for the n-stem nominative
  singular found in Gothic and Old English.
