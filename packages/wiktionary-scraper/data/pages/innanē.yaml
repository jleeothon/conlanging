  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From {{suffix|gem-pro|*in|*anē}}. The development of the form of the word is
  uncertain. If the vowel {{m|gem-pro||*-a-}} was not part of the suffix itself,
  it could have been picked up from similar words, namely {{m|gem-pro|*ubanē}},
  in which case the gemination had been introduced by analogy with
  {{m|gem-pro|*inn}} or {{m|gem-pro|*innai}}.<ref>{{R:Kroonen 2011}}</ref> If
  the original allative form of {{m|gem-pro||*inn}} were Pre-Germanic
  {{m|ine-pro||*en-no}}, then the ablative could have been built upon that, or
  as likely the locative {{m|ine-pro||*en-noy}}, which would explain the vowel
  and the gemination.
