  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{unk|gem-pro|Uncertain}} etymology.


  One theory derives it from {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*skey-|*skēi-b-}},
  {{m|ine-pro||*ski-b-}}. Compare {{cog|lt|skiẽbti||to rip up}},
  {{cog|lv|škibît||to cut, lop}}. ({{m+|gem-pro|*skapjaną}} has been considered
  related as well, but the phonetics pose difficulties.) The original meaning
  inherited from {{cog|ine-pro|-}} was likely “hollowed tree”, and all daughter
  languages agree in the meaning 'ship', thus the specified meaning “ship” is
  assumed for {{cog|gem-pro|-}}, however the {{cog|goh|-}} word also had the
  meaning “hollow object”, so the {{cog|gem-pro|-}} word could also have been
  used in a more generic fashion. Moreover, one meaning does not have to exclude
  the other by rule. Cf. {{cog|la|vās||hollow object}}, source of
  {{cog|fr|vaisseau||vessel}}.


  Kroonen instead claims that this word would rather be a loanword from
  {{bor|gem-pro|la|scyphus||drinking
  vessel}}.<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG|page=446|head=*skipa-}}</ref>
