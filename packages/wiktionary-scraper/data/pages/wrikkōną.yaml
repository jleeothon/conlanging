  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From Pre-Germanic {{m|ine-pro||*wriḱnéh₂-}}, a zero-grade iterative from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*wreyḱ-||to twist, turn}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈwrik.kɔː.nɑ̃/}}


  ===Verb===

  {{gem-verb}}


  # to [[twist]], [[turn]]


  ====Inflection====

  The original paradigm consisted of two stem variants, singular
  {{m|gem-pro||*wrikk-}} against non-singular {{m|gem-pro||*wrig-}}.

  {{gem-conj-wk2|wrikk}}


  ====Related terms====

  * {{l|gem-pro|*wraihaz}}

  * {{l|gem-pro|*wrīhaz}}

  * {{l|gem-pro|*wrīhô}}


  ====Descendants====

  The latter Middle English forms are adduced as loans from continental Germanic
  languages, but could also represent dialectal preservations. The iteratives
  are usually best attested in the Middle and later stages of Germanic languages
  anyway.


  The German form was borrowed from another Germanic language, probably either
  Dutch or Low German.
