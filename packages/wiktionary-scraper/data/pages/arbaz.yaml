  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{root|gem-pro|ine-pro|*h₃erbʰ-}}

  From Pre-Germanic {{m|ine-pro|*h₃órbʰos||orphan}}, from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*h₃erbʰ-}}.


  The inherited meaning "orphan" likely gave way to "worker", probably from
  orphans being used for forced labor by their caretakers, which is also implied
  by the Slavic meaning "servant, slave". In this context it is not hard to see
  a connection with {{cog|gem-pro|*arbaidiz||labor, toil}}, probably through a
  verb {{m|gem-pro|*arbijaną}}.
