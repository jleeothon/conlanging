  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From pre-Grimm {{m|ine-pro||*petwṓr}}, with an irregular consonant change from
  {{m|ine-pro||*kʷetwṓr}}, the neuter form of
  {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*kʷetwóres}}. The consonant change was probably caused
  by the influence of the ''*p-'' in the word for "five", {{m|ine-pro|*pénkʷe}}.
  The expected outcome would have been "hedwōr". <ref name="Ringe

  ====Derived terms====

  * {{l|gem-pro|*fedwōr tigiwiz}}


  ====Related terms====

  * {{l|gem-pro|*feþur-}}


  ====Descendants====

  In North and West Germanic, the form lost its ''*-d-'', from which the
  attested forms are descended. In Old Norse, this would have given *''fjór'',
  but plural adjective endings were then added to this form. Though the middle
  consonant is only preserved in Gothic, a fossil is found in
  {{ncog|non|fjaðryndaland|'''fjaðr'''yndaland|the land of four hundreds}}.
