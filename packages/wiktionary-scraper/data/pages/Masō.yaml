  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From a {{der|gem-pro|cel|-}} language, presumably
  {{der|gem-pro|cel-pro|*Mosā}}. Despite the obvious similarities, the name is
  not derived from {{cog|la|Mosa}}. It shows evidence of the change from of
  ''o'' to ''a''; this is known to have occurred before the first contact of
  Germanic people with the Romans, but probably after first contact with the
  Celts. Most likely, Latin and Germanic both borrowed the name from Celtic
  independently.


  Albrecht Greule writes that its ultimate origin is unclear, but could perhaps
  be {{cog|ine-pro|*meh₂d-|id=wet}}, whence {{cog|la|madeō||I am wet}} and
  {{cog|grc|μεστός||full}}.<ref
  name="Greule">{{R:de:Greule|page=333b|entry=Maas}}</ref>  Or, from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*mā-||to stupefy}} in the sense of the river's
  tortuousness, cognate with {{cog|gem-pro|*masōną||to confound, be weary,
  dream}} (modern {{cog|en|maze}}), {{cog|cy|mydu||to vault, arch}},
  {{cog|non|meis||curvatura}}.<ref>Ferguson, Robert (1862): The River-names of
  Europe, p. 142</ref>
