  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Likely from {{der|la|ine-pro|*līno-}}.


  Cognates include {{cog|la|līnum}} and all its derivatives.


  Although {{m+|el|λίνον}}, {{m+|la|linas}}, {{m+|ru|лён}} are sometimes listed
  as cognates, they actually derive from {{m|ine-pro|*lino-}} with a short /i/.


  Considering also the existence of a Latin root with a short /i/ and a /t/
  ({{m|la|linteum}}), reconstruction of a common PIE protoform is impossible,
  and no similarly sounding terms are attested outside of Europe.


  If such roots were borrowed from one or several non-IE languages, locating the
  source is impossible because cultivation of linen was ubiquitous in the region
  since the Neolithic.
