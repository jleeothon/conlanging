  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Of {{unk|gem-pro|unclear|nocap=1}} origin; the word was either borrowed from
  an unknown language or constructed from native material in late
  Proto-Germanic. The word has been connected by Walde 1910 to the Ancient Greek
  words {{m|grc|κλίβανος}}, {{m|grc|κρίβανος||baker's oven; pan with a lid for
  baking bread}} and {{m|grc|κλιβανίτης||bread baked in a κλίβανος}}, which
  according to Beekes is probably a borrowing from an unknown
  {{der|gem-pro|qfa-sub|-}} language. The Germanic word could well have been
  borrowed from the same source. If so, it would be an early borrowing, since
  the word then apparently displays the effects of Grimm's Law.


  Compare {{cog|lv|klàips|t=loaf}}, {{cog|lt|kliẽpas|t=loaf}}
  ({{cog|ine-pro|*kʷel-}} is suggested as their origin, owing to the fact that
  the earliest flatbreads were disk-shaped.)
