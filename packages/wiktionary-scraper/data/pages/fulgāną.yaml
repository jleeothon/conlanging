  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Uncertain. Possibly originated as a compound of the roots of
  {{m|gem-pro|*fullaz||full}} and {{m|gem-pro|*gāną||to go}}, with a sense of
  "full-going". This could have shifted to a meaning of "to serve, go with as an
  attendant" (compare also {{m|en|fulfill}}).


  Alternatively, may be derived from {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*pelḱ-}},
  {{m|ine-pro|*polḱ-||to turn, twist, wind}}, which itself might have merged
  with another verb to form {{cog|gem-pro|*felhaną||to conceal}}, but also ("to
  go, proceed").<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG}}</ref>
