  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-decl-adj-a|þiudisk}}


  ====Descendants====

  In the late Middle Ages, the word acquired a specialized sense referring to
  [[vernacular]] Germanic languages on the continent, specifically, Dutch,
  German, and Low German, which were not strongly distinguished from each other
  at the time, as opposed to the Latin of the scholarly elite and the Church.
  Because of the Holy Roman Empire's preeminence, the word narrowed in meaning
  to refer solely to German in most languages, with {{cog|en|Dutch}} and archaic
  {{cog|nl|Diets||Middle Dutch}} being notable exceptions.
