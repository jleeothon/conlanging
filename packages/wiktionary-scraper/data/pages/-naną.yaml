  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Reconstructed by Ringe<ref>{{R:gem:PIEPG}}</ref> from an alternating suffix
  {{m|gem-pro||*-n≈ç-}} (singular) ~ {{m|gem-pro||*-na-}} (nonsingular), from
  {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro||*-n√©h‚ÇÇ-}} ~ {{m|ine-pro||*-nh‚ÇÇ-}}, from n-infix
  presents to laryngeal-final roots that were reanalysed as a separate suffix
  (as in several other branches).


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/n…ë.n…ëÃÉ/}}


  ===Verb===

  {{gem-verb}}


  # {{non-gloss definition|Forms [[fientive]] verbs, with a sense of 'to become
  (the base)'.}}


  ====Inflection====

  These verbs are always intransitive, so there are no passive forms. They
  seemed to have originally lacked a past participle as well.

  ====Derived terms====

  {{derivsee|Proto-Germanic class 4 weak verbs}}


  ====Descendants====

  This suffix was preserved as a separate class only in Gothic. In Old High
  German, it mostly merged with the third weak class, while in the other
  descendants it merged with the second weak class.
