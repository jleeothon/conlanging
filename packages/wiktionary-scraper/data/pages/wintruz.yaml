  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{unk|gem-pro}}. Several possibilities have been proposed, although none are
  convincing:

  * Relation to {{cog|ine-pro|*wódr̥||water}}, whence also
  {{cog|gem-pro|*watōr}}.

  * Relation to {{cog|cel-pro|*windos||white}}.


  The first theory involves an analysis of {{cog|la|unda}} continuing
  {{m|ine-pro||*u-n-deh₂}} rather than {{m|ine-pro||*ud-neh₂}}, while there is
  little semantic evidence for the second theory.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈwin.truz/}}


  ===Noun===

  {{gem-noun|m}}


  # {{topics|gem-pro|Seasons|Winter}} [[winter]]

  ====Inflection====

  Most descendants (in particular Gothic) show a u-stem paradigm:

  {{gem-decl-noun}}

  However, Old Norse shows a consonant stem paradigm:

  {{gem-decl-noun|stem=cons|g=mf|wintr|nomsg=wintruz|vocsg=wintru}}

  If that is indeed the original paradigm, it may have arisen as follows: The
  nominative and vocative singular would have come from older
  {{m|gem-pro||*wintr̥-s}} and {{m|gem-pro||*wintr̥}}, respectively, into which
  an epenthetic ''u'' had been inserted before a syllabic sonorant, as is usual
  in Germanic. This formed {{m|gem-pro||*winturz}} and {{m|gem-pro||*wintur}}.
  The ''-ur-'' was then later metathesized into a form resembling a u-stem
  nominative (likely based on the accusative forms).
