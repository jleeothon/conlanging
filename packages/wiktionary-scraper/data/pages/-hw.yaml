  ===Etymology===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-k ∑e}}. Cognate with {{cog|la|-que}}.

  # [[and]]

  # {{non-gloss definition|Forms [[distributive]]s from interrogatives.}}


  ====Usage notes====

  This suffix was used to join two words, phrases or clauses together. It was
  attached to the word which should be joined to the previous, which was always
  the first word of the second clause or phrase. If the first word was a
  compound or had a prefix, the suffix was infixed after the first part of the
  compound or after the prefix, effectively splitting the word in two.


  It was also used to form several distributives by attaching it to existing
  interrogative words.


  When attached to a word that ended in an obstruent (and possibly other
  consonants as well), an epenthetic -u- was inserted, which caused the suffix
  to be delabialised through normal phonetic rules, turning it into
  {{m|gem-pro|*-uh}}.
