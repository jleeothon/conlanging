  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{root|gem-pro|ine-pro|*wed-}}

  From earlier {{m|gem-pro||*watskaną}}, from {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*wed-||wet,
  water}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈwɑs.kɑ.nɑ̃/}}


  ===Verb===

  {{gem-verb}}


  # to [[wash]]


  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-conj-st|class=7c|wask|wewask|wewask|wask}}

  The second-person singular past indicative form derives from the pre-Grimm
  form *wewaskt, which should have either been retained (since *sk was not
  shifted elsewhere) or become *wewasht after Grimm's law (through the Germanic
  spirant law). However, this cluster was likely simplified at some stage as
  neither the clusters -sh- nor -kt- occurred anywhere else in Germanic.
