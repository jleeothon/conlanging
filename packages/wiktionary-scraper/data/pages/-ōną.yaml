  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From two sources, both reflecting earlier {{m|gem-pro||*-≈çjanƒÖ}}:

  * From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-eh‚ÇÇy√©ti}}, an innovated compound suffix from
  {{m|ine-pro|*-√©h‚ÇÇ|pos=eh‚ÇÇ-stem noun suffix}} +
  {{m|ine-pro|*-y√©ti|pos=denominative suffix}}. These were originally formed as
  denominative verbs from ≈ç-stem nouns. When attached to {{l|en|thematic}}
  (a-stem) nouns, the thematic vowel was also retained, but the resulting
  compound suffix {{m|ine-pro||*-ey√©-}} became part of the first weak class
  instead.

  * From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-h‚ÇÇy√©ti|*-(e)h‚ÇÇy√©ti}}, an innovated compound
  suffix from {{m|ine-pro|*-h‚ÇÇti|*-(e)h‚ÇÇti|pos=factitive verb suffix}} which was
  originally athematic, but later extended with the thematic present suffix
  {{m|ine-pro|*-y√©ti}}.

  Cognates include {{cog|la|-ƒÅre|pos=first conjugation}},
  {{cog|grc|-Œ¨œâ|pos=contracted verb}}, {{cog|sa|-‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø|tr=-ƒÅÃÅyati}}.
