  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{root|gem-pro|ine-pro|*dʰwer-}}

  Likely back-formed from {{m|ine-pro||*dʰur-ih₁}}, an old neuter dual form,
  from {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*dʰwer-}}.<ref name="EDPG"/>


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/durz/}}


  ===Noun===

  {{gem-noun|f}}<ref name="EDPG">{{R:gem:EDPG|*durī-|110}}</ref>


  # [[door]], [[hatch]], [[flap]]


  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-decl-noun}}


  ====Usage notes====

  This word was a [[plurale tantum]] in Old Norse, and it might have been used
  in that way in Proto-Germanic as well (compare the same development with
  cognate {{m|sla-pro|*dvьrь|*dvьri}} in most Slavic languages); this is further
  evident by its form in compound words (e.g. compare {{cog|ang|ēagduru}},
  {{cog|goh|ougatora}}, {{m|goh|ougtora}}, {{cog|got|𐌰𐌿𐌲𐌰𐌳𐌰𐌿𐍂𐍉}}). In
  Old High German and Old Dutch it became a singular i-stem, which no doubt
  derives from the original plural. Old English and Old Saxon show a u-stem
  noun, which most likely derives from the singular because of the lack of
  umlaut.
