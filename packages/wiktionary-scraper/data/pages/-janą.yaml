  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/(i).j…ë.n…ëÃÉ/}}


  ===Etymology 1===

  From a merger of several {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|-}} suffixes, which had become
  alike because of the combination of [[w:Sievers' law|Sievers' law]] (j/ij) and
  i-mutation:


  * {{m|ine-pro|*-y√©ti|pos=denominative suffix}} attached to athematic stems.
  Cognates include Ancient Greek denominatives with -y- metathesis, verbs in
  {{m|grc|-ŒØœâ}} and {{m|grc|-œçœâ}}, Sanskrit denominative verbs in
  {{m|sa|-‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø|tr=-y√°ti}}.

  * {{m|ine-pro|*-ey√©ti}}, a compound suffix of {{m|ine-pro|*-e-|pos=noun
  thematic vowel}} + the above suffix. Cognates include most {{cog|la|-ƒ´re}}
  (fourth conjugation) verbs, some {{m|la|-ƒìre}} (second conjugation) verbs,
  most {{cog|grc|-Œ≠œâ}} contracted verbs, Sanskrit denominative verbs in
  {{m|sa|-‡§Ö‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø|tr=-ay√°ti}}.


  ====Suffix====

  {{head|gem-pro|suffix|cat2=verb-forming suffixes|head=*-(i)janƒÖ}}


  # {{non-gloss definition|Derives [[denominative]]s from nouns and
  [[factitive]]s from adjectives.}}


  =====Inflection=====

  Following a short stem, which consists of a short vowel followed by a single
  consonant, the suffix is *''-janƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk1|-|j=j}}


  Following a long stem, which has either a long vowel or diphthong, or a short
  vowel followed by several consonants, the suffix is *''-ijanƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk1|-|j=ij}}


  =====Derived terms=====

  {{suffixsee|gem-pro}}


  =====Descendants=====

  This suffix remained productive only in Gothic. It was preserved in Old Norse
  but was no longer productive in that language, its function having been taken
  over by {{m|gem-pro|*-≈çnƒÖ}}. In West Germanic, it had already almost
  disappeared in most languages except after -r-, and was no longer productive
  in those that retained it.

  ===Etymology 2===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-√©yeti|pos=causative suffix}}.


  ====Suffix====

  {{head|gem-pro|suffix|cat2=verb-forming suffixes|head=*-(i)janƒÖ}}


  # {{senseid|gem-pro|causative}}{{non-gloss definition|Derives [[causative]]s
  from basic strong verbs, with a sense of 'cause to do (the action of the
  verb)'. The stem vowel of the derived verb becomes that of the singular past
  tense, and the final consonant becomes the voiced Verner alternant.}}


  =====Inflection=====

  Following a short stem, which consists of a short vowel followed by a single
  consonant, the suffix is *''-janƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk1|-|j=j}}


  Following a long stem, which has either a long vowel or diphthong, or a short
  vowel followed by several consonants, the suffix is *''-ijanƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk1|-|j=ij}}


  =====Derived terms=====

  {{suffixsee|gem-pro|id=causative}}


  ===Etymology 3===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*-h‚ÇÅy√©ti}}, an innovated compound suffix from
  {{m|ine-pro|*-√©h‚ÇÅti|pos=stative verb suffix}} which was originally athematic,
  but later extended with the thematic present suffix {{m|ine-pro|*-y√©ti}} based
  on the past participle.<ref>{{R:gem:PIEPG}}</ref> Cognate with Latin stative
  verbs in {{m|la|-ƒìre}} (second conjugation).


  ====Suffix====

  {{head|gem-pro|suffix|cat2=verb-forming suffixes|head=*-(i)janƒÖ}}


  # {{non-gloss definition|Creates [[stative]] verbs either directly from roots
  or from other verbs.}}


  =====Inflection=====

  Following a short stem, which consists of a short vowel followed by a single
  consonant, the suffix is *''-janƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk3-j|-|j=j}}


  Following a long stem, which has either a long vowel or diphthong, or a short
  vowel followed by several consonants, the suffix is *''-ijanƒÖ''.

  {{gem-conj-wk3-j|-|j=ij}}


  =====Derived terms=====

  {{derivsee|Proto-Germanic class 3 weak j-present verbs}}


  =====Descendants=====

  This suffix was no longer productive in any of the daughter languages, and in
  West Germanic it quickly became a relic class and mostly merged with the
  second weak class, except in Old High German where it was preserved longer. In
  Old High German and Gothic, the class of verbs formed by this suffix merged
  with those derived with {{m|gem-pro|*-ƒÅnƒÖ}}, creating a single unified third
  weak class.
