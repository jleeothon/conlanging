  ===Etymology===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*ne|t=not}}.

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ne/}}


  ===Particle===

  {{gem-particle}}<ref>{{R:gem:PIEPG}}</ref>


  # [[not]]


  ====Usage notes====

  * This word was a general negation particle, and always preceded the word that
  is negated. Since imperative forms of verbs were always placed first in the
  sentence, the particle could not precede it. Therefore if the imperative form
  of a verb was to be negated, the subjunctive was used instead. If a verb with
  an adverbial prefix needed to be negated, the word was normally inserted
  between the prefix and the main verb stem.


  ====Related terms====

  * {{l|gem-pro|*nehw}}

  * {{l|gem-pro|*un-}}


  ====Descendants====

  This word does not survive in its original use in any modern language. Over
  time it usually became strengthened by other words, creating phrases such as
  "never", "not at all" or "not a thing". Eventually these phrases became the
  normal way of negating phrases, and this word fell into disuse. See
  [[w:Jespersen's Cycle|Jespersen's Cycle]] on Wikipedia for more.
