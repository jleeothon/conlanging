  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Possibly from a {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro||*-neh₁}}, which would also be the
  source of {{cog|sa|विना||without}} and possibly {{cog|la|supernē||from
  above}}. The final vowel itself is uncertain; it is usually given as
  {{m|gem-pro||*-ē}} based on the possibly related forms above.<ref>{{R:Kroonen
  2011|85}}</ref>


  The first vowel {{m|gem-pro||*-a-}} might not have originally been part of the
  suffix at all, possibly being detached from the forms the suffix was attached
  to; but it is usually found as such in Germanic languages.
