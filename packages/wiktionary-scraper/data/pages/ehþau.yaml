  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  Compound of {{m|gem-pro|*eh||but, except}} + {{m|gem-pro|*þau}}, the former
  being the only Germanic evidence of Proto-Indo-European
  {{m|ine-pro|*h₁eǵʰs}}/''*h₁eḱ(s)''. While the Germanic form could
  theoretically also represent ''*eþ-þau'', the form ''*eh-þau'' is required by
  the Gothic reflex, where expected ''*𐌹𐌸-'' is instead ''𐌰𐌹𐌸-'', which
  shows the following consonant must have been ''-𐌷-'', ''-𐍈-'' or ''-𐍂-'';
  and further shows the Proto-Germanic form itself had not yet become ''*eþþau''
  as it did in the daughter languages. For the semantics, compare
  {{cog|cel-pro|*extos||except, but}}, {{cog|grc|ἐκτός||without, outside;
  except}}.
