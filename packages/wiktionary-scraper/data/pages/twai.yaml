  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-decl-num-2}}


  The declension of this term can not be completely reconstructed. While the
  genitive, dative, and instrumental forms agree in all descendants where
  attested, the nominative forms found in Gothic and Old Norse do not match
  those found in the West Germanic languages. Some of these forms may preserve
  relics of the Indo-European dual inflection.


  Both the Gothic and Old Norse nominative and accusative forms were re-formed
  by adding adjective endings to a base stem.


  In Gothic:

  * Nominative: tw-ai, tw-≈çs, tw-a (based on g≈çd-ai, g≈çd-≈çs, g≈çd-a)

  * Accusative: tw-ans, tw-≈çs, tw-a (based on g≈çd-ans, g≈çd-≈çs, g≈çd-a)


  In early Old Norse (before the loss of final -u from the neuter plural):

  * Nominative: *twa-(a)i Ä, *twa(i)-a Ä, *tw(a)-u (based on *g≈ç√∞-(a)i Ä, *g≈ç√∞-a Ä,
  *g≈ç√∞-u)

  * Accusative: *twa-a, *twa(i)-a Ä, *tw(a)-u (based on *g≈ç√∞-a, *g≈ç√∞-a Ä, *g≈ç√∞-u)


  In West Germanic, the masculine form was extended with a suffix containing
  ''-n-'' of an unknown origin, to which all languages except Old English have
  added the regular masculine plural ending of adjectives. The feminine form may
  have been *''twƒÅ'', possibly contracted from a variant *''twa-≈ç(z)'' to which
  the regular feminine plural ending was added. The Old Saxon and Old High
  German form ''tw≈ç''/''zw≈ç'' must go back to an original *''tw≈ç(z)'', however.


  The neuter form seems to go back to *''twai'' in all West Germanic languages,
  except for the alternative Old English form which may have been reanalysed in
  a similar way to Old Norse. However, as the Gothic script does not indicate
  vowel length for ''a'', the neuter form may have also been ''twƒÅ'', in which
  case it may descend from an earlier *''twa-≈ç'', which may descend from an even
  earlier *''twaj≈ç'' in which ''-j-'' was regularly lost in late Proto-Germanic.
  This ''-≈ç'' may have been added to the original *''twai'' to create a new form
  with inflection parallel to the adjectives, which was retained in the ancestor
  of North and East Germanic while it was lost again in West Germanic.
