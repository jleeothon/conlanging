  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From pre-Germanic ''*-ut'', oblique ''*-ít-''. The suffix is also found in
  Latin {{m|la|caput}}, oblique ''capit-'', and Celtic {{m|cel-pro|*karuts}}
  (Old Irish {{m|sga|caur}}), which is additionally cognate to the Germanic
  ethnonym ''*Harudiz'', attested as Latin {{m|la|Harudes}}.


  ===Suffix===

  {{gem-noun||suff=1}}


  # {{non-gloss definition|Forms [[noun]] stems.}}


  ====Inflection====

  {{gem-decl-noun-irreg|-ud-|-ud-|-ud-|-iþ-|-iþ-|-iþ-|-ud-|-ud-|-ud-|-iþ-|-iþ-|-iþ-}}


  ====Derived terms====

  The suffix was originally a consonant-stem, probably masculine or neuter in
  origin, which showed a strong tendency towards thematicization in the daughter
  languages, with generalization of either the strong or weak stem.
