  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  {{unk|gem-pro|title=Uncertain}}. Often linked to {{m|gem-pro|*bōkō|t=beech}},
  though beechbark-writing, unlike {{w|Birch bark
  manuscript|birchbark-writing}}, is not known, nor is it well imaginable that
  it was the time for [[bookfell]]s made from beeches already. Connected by some
  to {{der|gem-pro|ine-pro|*bʰeh₂g-|t=to allot}} ascribing to the word the
  meaning of “letter” in the sense of merely one or few symbols because letters
  would have primitively been ownership symbols, which would then have been
  generalized to any work with writing upon it.
