  ==Proto-Germanic==


  ===Etymology===

  From {{inh|gem-pro|ine-pro|*mélit}}.


  ===Pronunciation===

  * {{IPA|gem-pro|/ˈmi.li/}}


  ===Noun===

  {{gem-noun|n}}


  # {{topics|gem-pro|Food and drink}} [[honey]]


  ====Inflection====

  The nominative singular form lacks the final consonant of the stem, similar to
  {{m|gem-pro|*alu}}, due to Pre-Germanic loss of final ''*-t''. However, in
  this case, ''*þ'' became ''*d'' in the oblique cases due to Verner's law.

  {{gem-decl-noun}}


  ====Descendants====

  Mostly in compounds, where the first part was later reanalysed as meaning
  'flour' in most languages.
