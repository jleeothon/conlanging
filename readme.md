# Conlang1

Design philosophy:

- based on Proto-Germanic,
- morphologically less complex than Proto-Germanic but more complex than modern
  Germanic languages,
- complex but highly symmetric,
- I have to like it.

Design guidelines:

- biased towards Low Saxon,
- no Nasal-Spirant Law and no Second Consonant Shift,
- North Germanic loans integrated when they help find symmetry,
- pro-drop although without 1:1 perfect correspondences of ending and
  person-number.
