# Slumpisk

Design philosophy:

-   based on some point between Proto-Germanic and Proto-West-Germanic,
-   morphologically less complex than Proto-Germanic,
-   complex but highly symmetric.

Design guidelines:

-   no Nasal-Spirant Law and no Second Consonant Shift,
-   North Germanic grammatical and lexical loans integrated when they help find symmetry,
-   pro-drop.
