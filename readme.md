# Slumpisk

Design philosophy:

-   based on Proto-Germanic,
-   morphologically less complex than Proto-Germanic but more complex than
    modern Germanic languages,
-   complex but highly symmetric,
-   I have to like it.

Design guidelines:

-   biased towards Low Saxon,
-   no Nasal-Spirant Law and no Second Consonant Shift,
-   North Germanic loans integrated when they help find symmetry,
-   pro-drop although without 1:1 perfect correspondences of ending and
    person-number.
