### Consonants

| Plain | Pronunciation           |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| p     | /p/                     |
| b     | /b/, /v/ (M), /f/ (F)   |
| t     | /t/                     |
| d     | /d/                     |
| k     | /k/                     |
| g     | /g/, /ɣ/ (M), /x~ç/ (F) |
| f     | /f/                     |
| þ     | /θ/                     |
| s     | /s/                     |
| h     | /h/, /x~ç/ (F)          |
| l     | /l/                     |
| r     | /r/                     |
| m     | /m/                     |
| n     | /n/, /ŋ/ before velars  |
| j     | /j/                     |
| w     | /w/                     |

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at word boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

- /g/ initially,
- /gː/ when written ⟨gg⟩
- /ɣ/ medially between sonorants,
- /x/ medially otherwise and finally.

## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, and determiners decline for number, case, animacy.

There are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive. Animacy (animate, inanimate) is only relevant in singular
accusative declensions.

Nouns have strong and weak paradigms.

- The weak paradigm is used with a determiner.
- The strong noun paradigm is used when a determiner is left out.

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form. Otherwise they have three
declension paradigms.

- When preceding a noun, adjectives decline with a weak paradigm (e.g. _þe
  rauda apol_ "the red apple").
- Some adjectives can work as function as determiners, and when so, decline as
  determiners (e.g. _þe fawa aplan_ "the few apples").
- When an adjective takes the places of a noun, it declines with a strong
  paradigm (e.g. _þe rauda_ "the red ones").

Most adjectives have comparative and superlative forms.

Verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, and mood.

- There are three persons, and two numbers (singular and plural).
- The moods are: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative.
- Non-composite tenses are: present, preterite (both in the indicative). Many
  composite forms are possible.
- Non-finite forms include: infinitive, past infinitive, present participle,
  past participle.

There are two main regular verb systems: weak and strong. There are irregular
verbs.

V2 order is preferred when the verb is not the first word in a sentence. Finite
verb sequences prefer to be head initial e.g. _Skölde willon eton_ "I/he/she
should want to eat".

Adjectives usually precede nouns.

Adverbs usually precede verbs, but can also follow them. The adverb _ne_ (not)
can only appear before, not after.

## Sentence building

### Questions

Positive yes-no questions can be built by starting the question with a verb
followed by _ne_. Example:

- Etes ne krabban? _Do you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _ja_ or _ne_.

Negative yes-no questions can be built by start the question with the negated
verb followed by _jah_.

- Ne etes jah krabban? _Don't you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _jah_ or _neh_.

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses have the same word order as main clauses; the V2 rule is observed.

They can be introduced by relative pronouns and other pro-forms, which look like the interrogative forms (hwe, hwa, etc.). In the case of pronouns, they take the case of the referent in the subordinate clause. Prepositional pronouns and pro-forms also introduce relative clauses. For example:

- _Þe hund hwe blaffet ilke dag is mein._ "The dog which barks ever day is
  mine."
- _Þe hund hwem sah was brún._ "The dog which I saw is brown."
- _Þe hund, hwes aiganor singet ilke morgin, is hail frijendleik._ "The dog,
  whose owner sings ever morning, is friendly."
- _Þe feld hwar þe skáp at þet gras._ "The field where the sheep at the
  grass."
- _Þe mánoþ hwan blómai förskeinen._ "The month when the flowers appear."
- _Þaht at willes eton þet_ "I thought that you wanted to eat it."

Naturally they can also be introduced by conjunctions derived from prepositions. For example:

-
