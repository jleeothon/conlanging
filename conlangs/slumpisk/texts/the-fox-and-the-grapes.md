One day, a hungry fox saw a vine und some grapes that hung from it.

The grapes were big und plump und deep red, und the fox's mouth dripped while it
look at them. Never before did he see grapes this big und plump und deep red.

The grapes hung from a tall branch. The fox jumped to catch them, but could not
reach them. Then it walked back und ran und jumped to the grapes, und stretched
its neck, but could also not reach them.

Sore said the fox: «What a fool one I am. I tire myself for some sour grapes.
They are not worthy.»

And it walked away.
