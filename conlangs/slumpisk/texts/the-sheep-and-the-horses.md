# þe skáp und þe hrossi

En skáp, hwe had net woll, sah suman hrossan: ait, hwe tauh et swára wagon; ait,
hwe drug et grauta hlód; und ait, hwem en mann raid.

þe skáp sagede an þen hrossan: «þe hert mien is sair hwan ik seheo hwus þe mann
dreibet þen hrossan.»

þe hrossan antwordeden: «hlüsne þu skáp. Þus leiþen þea hertan unsar: þe mann
doept for sih et klaiþ ut þet woll þes skápas und þe skáp ne mair hebbet woll.

þat hlüsned, flauh þe skáp til þet feld.

A sheep, who had no wool, saw some horses: one, who pulled a heavy wagon; one,
who carried a big load; und one, whom a man rode.

The sheep said to the horses: «My heart pains, when I see how the man drives the
horses.»

The horses answered: «Listen, sheep. Thus suffer our hearts: the man makes for
himself a garment out of the sheep's wool, und the sheep has no more wool.»

This heard, the sheep fled to the field.
