The vowel ⟨ŭ⟩ is used in dictionaries and grammars to represent full vowels in
vowel-zero alternations.

### Consonants

Consonants come in (up to) three variants: plain, w-variant, j-variant.

In the following table:

- (I) means "in initial position".
- (M) means "in medial position".
- (F) means "in final position".
- Unmarked pronunciations mean "otherwise".

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at internal boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

Notes:

⟨b⟩ can be realised as /b/ everywhere, but is recommended to be realised as:

- /b/ initially or when written ⟨bb⟩,
- /v/ medially between sonorants,
- /f/ medially otherwise and finally;

E.g. ⟨bér⟩ /bɛːr/ "bear", ⟨halb⟩ /half/ "half".

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

- /g/ initially and medially,
- /x/ finally.

Note: "sk" allows "dialectal variation" as /sx/ or /ʃ/, and optionally only
before "i" and "e".

Haven't fully decided on the spelling and pronunciation of ⟨b⟩. In the
word-middle and word-end, it may be ⟨v⟩, thus the pronunciation better
distinguished.

Geminated consonants may exist. I'm not sure what to do with them, especially
when they occur at the word-end; they may be trigger tone change.

#### Consonant alternations

W- and j-variants' realisations alternate when they appear at the end of a stem
and a word is suffixed or unsuffixed.

For example:

- ⟨farw⟩ "colour" is realised /farg/.
- ⟨farwan⟩ "colours" is realised /farwan/.
