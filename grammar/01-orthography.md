## Orthography and phonology

### Vowels

### Consonants

Consonants come in (up to) three variants: plain, w-variant, j-variant.

In the following table:

-   (I) means "in initial position".
-   (M) means "in medial position between sonorants".
-   (F) means "in final position or before a consonant".
-   Unmarked pronunciations mean "otherwise".

| Plain | Pronunciation           |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| p     | /p/                     |
| b     | /b/, /v/ (M), /f/ (F)   |
| t     | /t/                     |
| d     | /d/                     |
| k     | /k/                     |
| g     | /g/, /ɣ/ (M), /x~ç/ (F) |
| f     | /f/                     |
| þ     | /θ/                     |
| s     | /s/                     |
| h     | /h/, /x~ç/ (F)          |
| l     | /l/                     |
| r     | /r/                     |
| m     | /m/                     |
| n     | /n/, /ŋ/ before velars  |
| j     | /j/                     |
| w     | /w/                     |

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at internal boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

Notes:

⟨b⟩ can be realised as /b/ everywhere, but is recommended to be realised as:

-   /b/ initially,
-   /bː/ when written ⟨bb⟩
-   /v/ medially between sonorants,
-   /f/ medially otherwise and finally.

E.g. ⟨bér⟩ /bɛːr/ "bear", ⟨halb⟩ /half/ "half".

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

-   /g/ initially,
-   /gː/ when written ⟨gg⟩
-   /ɣ/ medially between sonorants,
-   /x/ medially otherwise and finally.

Note: "sk" allows "dialectal variation" as /sx/ or /ʃ/, and optionally only
before "i" and "e". 💭💭💭 Maybe it should be spelled ⟨sc⟩.

What happens with geminated consonants at the word-end. 💭💭💭 Maybe they
trigger minor tone changes, like Swedish tonemes.
