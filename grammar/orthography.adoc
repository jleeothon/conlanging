= Orthography

[.normal]
The Þeudisk-H alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet.

== Vowels

=== Monophthongs

[cols="s,1,s,1"]
|===
2+| Short 2+| Long

| i | /ɪ/ | í | /iː/
| e | /ɛ/ | é | /eː/ ~ /eɪ̯/

| u | /ʊ/ | ú | /uː/
| o | /ɔ/ | ó | /oː/ ~ /oʊ̯/
| a | /ɑ/ | á | /aː/

| ü | /ʏ/ | ű | /yː/
| ö | /œ/ | ő | /øː/
| ä | /ɛ/ | a̋ | /ɛː/

=== Diphthongs

All diphthongs have the same phonemic length as a long monophthong.

| ei | /eɪ̯/ ~ /iː/
| eu | /øʏ̯/
| ai | /ai̯/
| au | /au̯/
| äi | /əɪ̯/
| äu | /əʊ̯/

=== Weak vowel

The weak vowel is pronounced as a *mid-central vowel* /ə/, or may be *elided*
when elision does not produce too many obstruents in succession.

It is spelled according to these rules, in this order:

1. In a last syllable, it is spelled ⟨ĕ⟩.
2. In a syllable followed by a syllable with ⟨ĕ⟩, it is spelled ⟨’⟩.
3. In a syllable followed by a syllable with ⟨’⟩, it is spelled ⟨ĕ⟩.
4. Otherwise, it is spelled ⟨ĕ⟩.

The weak vowel is more likely to be elided when it is spelled as ⟨’⟩, and more
likely to be pronounced otherwise.

Examples:

- himĕl (_sky_)
- him’lĕr (_skies_)
- aftĕr (_after_)
- þe aft’rĕ mál (_the later/next meal_)

=== Sonorants

Four "`sonorant`" consonants are important to correct Þeudisk-H orthography.
These are: *j*, *w*, *m*, *n*, *l*, and *r*.

The sonorants affect the spelling of the fricatives.

=== Fricatives

There are three voiced-unvoiced pairs of fricatives in Þeudisk-H:

- *v* and *f*,
- *z* and *z*,
- *ð* and *þ*.

Although their standard pronunciations are respectively voiced and unvoiced,
their actual realisations may be voiced or unvoiced according to dialectal
variations, or euphony.

The rules for spelling fricatives depend on their context. Given that
"`vowels-or-sonorants`" is the union set of vowels and sonorants, the rules are:

|===
| Position | Variant | Context | Example

h| Start of morpheme
| Unvoiced
| Always
| **þ**örv.an (_to need_) +
bĕ.**þ**örv.ing (_necessity_)

.2+h| Middle of morpheme
| Voiced
| Between any two vowels-or-sonorants
| _No examples_
| Unvoiced
| Elsewhere
| _No examples_

.2+h| End of morpheme
| Voiced
| When suffixed, such that after suffixation, the phoneme stands between any two
vowels-or-sonorants. Only applies to bound morphemes.
| þör**v**.an (_to need_), +
we þör**v**.ĕm (_we need_)
| Unvoiced
| Elsewhere
| ek þar**f** (_I need_) +
ek þor**f**.dĕ (_I needed_)
