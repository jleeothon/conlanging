## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut weak, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular
verbs.

All infinitives are prefixed with _a-_, spelled with a dash.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Regular weak verbs have one stem.

Rückumlaut weak verbs have two stems: one for the present and one for the
preterite.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

### Pronoun dropping

**Pronoun dropping:** because all past paradigms, and the present paradigm of
preterite-present verbs have conflated forms for the 1st and 3rd person, and
sometimes the participle, the first or third person pronouns tend to be
explicitly marked where there is no context (in all past paradigms, and the
present paradigm of preterite present verbs).

### Conjugation paradigms

### Strong verbs

Strong verbs follow an ablaut pattern. There are several ablaut patterns:

| Class | Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | ei                 | ai              | i               |
| 2     | eu                 | au              | u               |
| 34e   | e                  | a               | o               |
| 34i   | i                  | a               | u               |
| 5e    | e                  | a               | e               |
| 5i    | i                  | a               | i               |
| 6e    | a                  | u               | a               |
| 6a    | e                  | u               | a               |
| 7a    | ai                 | ei              | ai              |
| 7b    | au                 | eu              | au              |
| 7c-e  | a                  | e               | a               |
| 7c-i  | a                  | i               | a               |
| 7d    | á                  | é               | á               |
| 7e    | ó                  | é               | ó               |

Here are some examples; each verb is provided in present and past infinitive,
and past participle:

- _streikan-straikan-strikun_ (to strike),
- _fleugan-flaugan-flugun_ (to fly),
- _helpan-halpan-holpun_ (to help),
- _bindan-bandan-bundun_ (to bind).
- _geban-gaban-gebun_ (to give),
- _sitan-satan-situn_ (to sit),
- _faran-furan-farun_ (to travel),
- _swaran-swuran-swaran_ (to swear),
- _haitan-heitan-haitun_ (to be named),
- _hlaupan-hleupan-hlaupun_ (to walk),
- _fallan-fellan-fallun_ (to fall),
- _fangan-fingan-fagun_ (to grasp),
- _látan-létan-látun_ (to let),
- _hrópan-hrépan-hrópun_ (to call).

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

### Weak verbs

Regular weak verbs can be distinguished according to their endings:

- weak verbs ending in _-jun_,
- weak verbs ending in _-wun_,
- weak verbs ending in _-ilun_,
- weak verbs ending in _-nun_.

### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./4-3-verbs-rückumlaut.md).

### Preterite-present verbs

In the present, preterite-present verbs have different stems for singular and
plural conjugations. The present infinitive has the same stem as the plural
conjugations.

The preterite stem is the same for all preterite finite and non-finite forms.

Preterite-present verbs conjugate with these endings (dental suffix may be _d_
or _t_):

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./4-4-verbs-preterite-present.md).

### Irregular verbs

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./4-5-verbs-irregular.md).

### Verb periphrasis

Verb periphrasis can be done by putting two verbs together, head-last. Some
important constructions:

_skolun_ + infinitive: marks the future tense. E.g. _skal milkun þen kuw_ "I
shall milk the cow".

_skoldun_ + infinitive: marks the irrealis mood, or used as an infinitive for
future-in-past. E.g. _skolde a-wesen reik, als skolke a-häben ait reika fadar_
"I would be rich if I had a rich father".

_gán_ + infinitive: marks future tense, informal; also just marks that the
subject physically goes to do something. E.g. _gás etun butans_ "you're going to
eat ourside".

_wesun_ + past participle: marks a passive voice. E.g. _irs ew hwan hrópen te
hwiel þes málteidas!_ "you're always called during meals".

_werþun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a change in state.
Can be analysed as _werþun_ + adjective.

_bleibun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a continuation of
state. Can be analysed as _bleibun_ + adjective.

More constructions are of course possible, and their meanings may sometimes be
obvious e.g. _wollun_ + infinitive.

⚠️ Not sure if to make things head first or head last.

### Derivation

#### Causatives

A weak verb can be derived by changing the ablaut vowel, and in some cases,
Verner alternation. The meaning of the derived verb is usually causative, or
intransitive from a transitive verb.

| Strong ablaut | Weak causative   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| ei-ai-i       | äi               |
| eu-au-u       | äu               |
| i-a-u         | ä                |
| e-a-o         | ä                |
| e-a-e         | ä                |
| i-a-i         | ä                |
| a-u-a         | ü                |
| a-i-a         |                  |
| á-é-á         | (Not productive) |
| ó-é-ó         | (Not productive) |

> ⚠️ Self-note: the sequence a-u-a should, by PGmc>Theudisk sound changes, be
> a-ó-a. But I'm considering a-ó-a, a-ú-a, a-u-a.
>
> The problem with a-u-a is that it may create derivative words that class. The
> problem that a-ó-a is that causative verbs would have the stem vowel
> "ó-umlaut", whose representation as "eu" is ugly, and the representation as
> "ő" would create a letter only marginally used. Also, would it have the same
> sound value as "eu"?
>
> The problem with a-ú-a, is similar: it could create a need for a letter "ű"
> (but it wouldn't conflict with "eu"). However, hlaþan-hlúþan-hláþun (to load,
> intr.) creates hlűdian-hlűdid. It may conflict with a verb from "hlúd"
> (noiise).

The consonant alternations are:

- þ > d
- s > r
- h > g

Examples include:

- _leiþan_ (to undergo) > _läidian_ (to lead)
- _beugan_ (to bend, intr.) > _bäugian_ (to bend sth.)
- _drinkan_ (to drink) > _dränkian_ (to make drink)
- _smertan_ (to hurt, intr.) > _smärtian_ (to cause pain)
- _hladan_ (to accumulate) > _hlődian_ (to load sth. into sth.)
- _fallan_ (to fall) > _fällian_ (to fell)

#### Prefixes

- **fór**: before
- **after**: after
- **fer**: start to
- **fir**: wrong
- **or**:
- **in**: in
