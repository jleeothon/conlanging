## Prepositions

When a preposition preceds (or follows) a noun phrase, the noun phrase is in the
nominative case, unless it is a pronoun, in which case it is followed by the
accusative.

This is a list of prepositions and words derived from them.

Unless specified, prepositions are followed by the accusative case when they
have a complement.
