In Gothic

- (a)r - locative
- (a)d - ablative (wrong)
- (a)þro - allative (wrong)

E.g. hwar (Where), hwaþ~hwad (to where), hwaþro (from where)

E.g. jainar (there), jaind (to there), jainþro (from there)

But the system for adverbial directionals from prepositions is different i.e. different ending.

- PGm -ai (Go -a, ON -i OHG -e)


| preposition | locative | allative | ablative |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| in          | inna     | inn      | innana   |
| us          |          |          |          |
