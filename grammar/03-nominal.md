## Nominal paradigms

All noun phrases must be "complete". A noun phrase is complete when:

- (a) it has a determiner,
- (b) or has no determiner but an strongly declined noun,
- (c) or has no determiner but a strongly declined adjective without a noun
  (e.g. _þe rauda_ "the red one"),
- (d) or is a pronoun.

In most cases, the number and case of a complete noun phrase is always noun.

In case (a), a noun is strongly

**Nouns** decline for number and case. There are weak and strong paradigms.

The **weak noun paradigm**:

|           | Singular | Plural |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom.-Acc. | -        | -an    |
| Gen.      | -as      | -ar    |

The **strong noun paradigm** is used in literary contexts and when a determiner
is dropped; it is:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -         | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

Regular nouns take no ending in the nominative singular; nouns from adjectives
(with an implicit noun e.g. the red one, the tall one) have the _-a_ ending.

There is an animacy distinction in the strong accusative singular: _-am_ for
animate and _-at_ for inanimate.

The **weak adjective paradigm** is used when a noun is preceded by a determiner:

|           | All numbers |
| --------- | ----------- |
| All cases | -a          |

The **strong adjective paradigm** is used when the noun is omitted:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -a        | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

### General notes

Distal pronouns are also used for referent, as in, "such person", "such thing",
"such kind", etc.

In the following tables, any **base form** and **irregular forms** are marked
with **bold**. Regular forms take endings from the strong noun paradigm (with
the inanimate ending).

Some determiners and pronouns have a animacy distinction in the singular
accusative, _-am_ or _-ar_. This distinction can be between personhood and
nonpersonhood, or animate and inanimate, according to context and preference.

### Personal pronouns

|      | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc. | 3rd sg epi. | 3rd fem. | 1st pl. | 2nd pl. | 3rd pl. | 3rd refl. |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Nom. | ik      | þu      | he            | þé          | se       | we      | je      | þái     |           |
| Acc. | mih     | þih     | hem           | þém/þét     | sem      | uns     | juh     | þén     | sih       |
| Gen. | mein    | þein    | hes           | þés         | ses      | unsar   | jewar   | þér     | sein      |

There is an animacy distinction in the 3rd person epicine singular pronoun. The
diacritic on the 3rd persons is only an ortographic convention to distinguish it
from the definite article.

As with the genitive of nouns, genitive pronouns ("possessives") follow the noun
they modify. They do not inflect. For example: _þe kat mien_ "my cat".

### Determiners

Determiners fully denote case and number; therefore they accompany
weakly-inflected nouns.

They are any of:

- definite and indefinite articles,
- demonstratives,
- quantifiers,
- numerals.

### Definite and indefinite articles and pronouns

The definite articles and definite pronoun are the same:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | þe        | þai    |
| Acc. | þem / þet | þan    |
| Gen. | þes       | þar    |

Note that the singular forms are the same as the 3rd person epicine pronouns.
There is only a subtle distinction betwen the definite pronouns and the 3rd
person pronouns. The definite pronouns tend to mean "the aforementioned". This
distinction is not important.

The indefinite article and indefinite pronouns:

|      | Singular    | Plural |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **en**      | ena    |
| Acc. | **em / et** | enan   |
| Gen. | **es**      | enar   |

Should I distinguish the definite article and pronoun❓ The article could look
like an unstressed form: _en, et, enas, enai, einan, enar_.

### Quantifiers

The negative quantifier, both article and pronoun, works like HG "kein" or
NL/NDS "keen", and follows the declension paradigm of _en_:

|      | Singular      | Plural |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **nen**       | nena   |
| Acc. | **nem / net** | nenan  |
| Gen. | **nes**       | nenar  |

Most other quantifiers have this declension paradigm:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -a        | -a     |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -as       | -ar    |

Some examples of quantifiers that follow that paradigm are: _alla_ "all",
_manga_ "many", _suma_ "some", _fawa_ "few".

### Demonstratives

The demonstrative pronouns are identical to demonstrative articles

|      | Proximal sg. | 〃 pl. | Medial sg. | 〃 pl. | Distal sg. | 〃 pl. |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **þis**      | þisai  | **þas**    | þasai  | **jain**   | jainai |
| Acc. | **þit**      | þisan  | **þat**    | þasan  | **jait**   | jainan |
| Gen. | þisas        | þisar  | þasas      | þasar  | jainas     | jainar |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

### Option or category

The words _hwelk_ "which, what kind", _hjelk_ "this one", _þelk_ "that one",
_sjelk_ "such one" are both determiners and pronouns.

They are inflected similarly, as strong nouns:

|      | Question sg.  | 〃 pl.  | Proximal sg.  | 〃 pl.  | Medial sg.   | 〃 pl. | Distal sg.    | 〃 pl.  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Nom. | **hwelk**     | hwelkai | **hjelk**     | hjelkai | **þelk**     | þelkai | **sjelk**     | sjelkai |
| Acc. | hwelkam / -at | hwelkan | hjelkam / -at | hjelkan | þelkam / -at | þelkan | sjelkam / -at | sjelkan |
| Gen. | hwelkan       | hwelkar | hjelkan       | hjelkar | þelkan       | þelkar | sjelkan       | sjelkar |

### Pro-person and pro-thing

The pro-person complement personal pronouns; they are _hwe_ "who", _hje_ "this
person(s)", _þje_ "that person(s)", _sje_ "such person(s)". They do not inflect
in number. The existential pro-person means "someone", and the negative
pro-person means "no one".

The pro-thing pronoun is similar to pro-persons. It only exists in a _hw-_ form.

Pro-person:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | 〃 pl. | Negative  |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Nom. | **hwe**  | **hains**  | hainai | **naims** |
| Acc. | **hwem** | **hain**   | hainan | **naim**  |
| Gen. | **hwes** | hainas     | hainar | naimas    |

Pro-thing:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | 〃 pl. | Negative |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Nom. | **hwa**  | **ihs**    | ihsai  | **nihs** |
| Acc. | **hwat** | **iht**    | ihsan  | **niht** |
| Gen. | **hwas** | ihsas      | ihsar  | nihsas   |

### Pro-adverbs

|                     | Question | Proximal | Medial | Comparative | Existential | Neg. Existential | Universal |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Time                | hwan     | hjan     | þan    | sjan        | erg hwan    | nerg hwan        | ew hwan   |
| Start (Time)        | hwens    | hjens    | þens   | sjens       | erg hwens   | nerg hwens       | ew hwens  |
| End (Time)          | hwiner   | hjiner   | þiner  | sjiner      | erg hwiner  | nerg hwiner      | ew hwiner |
| Place               | hwar     | hjar     | þar    | sjar        | erg hwar    | nerg hwar        | ew hwar   |
| Origin (Place)      | hwers    | hjers    | þers   | sjers       | erg hwers   | nerg hwers       | ew hwers  |
| Destination (Place) | hwiþer   | hjiþer   | þiþer  | sjiþer      | erg hwiþer  | nerg hwiþer      | ew hwiþer |
| Manner              | hwus     | hjus     | þus    | sjus        | erg hwus    | nerg hwus        | ew hwus   |

The time adverbs' meanings are: when, now, then, such moment, sometime, never,
always.

The start-of-time adverbs' meanings are: whence, since now, thence, since such
moment, since sometime, since never, always (emphasis on a fact that has always
been true).

The end-of-time adverbs' meanings are: until when, until now, until then, until
such moment, until sometime; _nerg hwiner_ and _ew hwiner_ may not have a
practical definition but could be used by analogy.

The place adverbs' meanings are: where, here, there, such place, somewhere,
nowhere, everywhere.

The start (place) adverbs' meanings are: wherefrom, herefrom, therefrom, from
such place, from somewhere, from nowhere, from everywhere.

The end (place) adverbs' meanings are: whereto, thereto, thereto, to such place,
to somewhere, to nowhere, to everywhere.

The adverbs of manner's meanings are: how, in this way, in that way, in such
way, somehow, in no way, in every way.

Note that many determiners are similar to related pronouns, but differ in the
vowel.

⚠️ Should make a family of pro-adverbs for "why" and "what for".

### Other

Other pro-forms can be built combining pro-persons, pro-things, and pro-adverbs
with prepositions. Pro-persons and pro-things inflect according to the case
governed by the preposition.

⚠️ Example needed.
