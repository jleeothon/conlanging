## Orthography and phonology

### Vowels

| Ortography | Pronunciation |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| i          | /ɪ/           |
| u          | /ʊ/           |
| e          | /ɛ/           |

### Consonants

| Plain | Pronunciation           |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| p     | /p/                     |
| b     | /b/, /v/ (M), /f/ (F)   |
| t     | /t/                     |
| d     | /d/                     |
| k     | /k/                     |
| g     | /g/, /ɣ/ (M), /x~ç/ (F) |
| f     | /f/                     |
| þ     | /θ/                     |
| s     | /s/                     |
| h     | /h/, /x~ç/ (F)          |
| l     | /l/                     |
| r     | /r/                     |
| m     | /m/                     |
| n     | /n/, /ŋ/ before velars  |
| j     | /j/                     |
| w     | /w/                     |

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at word boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

-   /g/ initially,
-   /gː/ when written ⟨gg⟩
-   /ɣ/ medially between sonorants,
-   /x/ medially otherwise and finally.

## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, and determiners decline for number, case, animacy.

There are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive. Animacy (animate, inanimate) is only relevant in singular
accusative declensions.

Nouns have strong and weak paradigms.

-   The weak paradigm is used with a determiner.
-   The strong noun paradigm is used when a determiner is left out.

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form. Otherwise they have three
declension paradigms.

-   When preceding a noun, adjectives decline with a weak paradigm (e.g. _þe
    rauda apol_ "the red apple").
-   Some adjectives can work as function as determiners, and when so, decline as
    determiners (e.g. _þe fawa aplan_ "the few apples").
-   When an adjective takes the places of a noun, it declines with a strong
    paradigm (e.g. _þe rauda_ "the red ones").

Most adjectives have comparative and superlative forms.

Verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, and mood.

-   There are three persons, and two numbers (singular and plural).
-   The moods are: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative.
-   Non-composite tenses are: present, preterite (both in the indicative). Many
    composite forms are possible.
-   Non-finite forms include: infinitive, past infinitive, present participle,
    past participle.

There are two main regular verb systems: weak and strong. There are irregular
verbs.

V2 order is preferred when the verb is not the first word in a sentence. Finite
verb sequences prefer to be head initial e.g. _Skölde willon eton_ "I/he/she
should want to eat".

Adjectives usually precede nouns.

Adverbs usually precede verbs, but can also follow them. The adverb _ne_ (not)
can only appear before, not after.

## Nouns and adjectives

All noun phrases must be "complete". A noun phrase is complete when:

-   it has a determiner,
-   or has no determiner but a strongly declined noun,
-   or has no determiner but a strongly declined adjective without a noun,
-   or is a pronoun.

For the acccusative singular of the next paradigms, _-am_ is the animate ending,
and _-at_ is the inanimate.

The **weak noun paradigm**:

|          | Nominative & Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Singular | -                       | -as      |
| Plural   | -an                     | -ar      |

The **strong noun paradigm**:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -          | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -ai        | -an        | -ar      |

The **weak adjective paradigm**:

|             | All cases |
| ----------- | --------- |
| All numbers | -a        |

The **strong adjective paradigm**:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -a         | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -ai        | -an        | -ar      |

[determiner paradigm]: #determiner-paradigm

The <span id="determiner-paradigm">**determiner paradigm**</span>:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -          | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -a         | -an        | -ar      |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

## Determiners and pronouns

Determiners fully denote case and number; therefore they accompany
weakly-inflected nouns.

They are any of:

-   definite and indefinite articles,
-   demonstratives,
-   quantifiers,
-   numerals.

The **definite articles** are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | þe         | þem / þet  | þes      |
| Plural   | þea        | þen        | þer      |

The **definite pronouns** are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative  | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Singular | þai        | þaim / þait | þais     |
| Plural   | þaia       | þain        | þair     |

The definite pronouns also appear under "personal pronouns".

The <span id="indefinite-article">**indefinite articles**</span> are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative            | Genitive  |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| Singular | en         | em (enam) / et (enat) | es (enas) |
| Plural   | ena        | enan                  | enar      |

[indefinite pronoun]: #indefinite-pronoun

The <span id="indefinite-pronoun">**indefinite pronoun**</span> is:

|          | Nominative | Accusative                | Genitive    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Singular | ain        | aim (ainam) / ait (ainat) | ais (ainas) |
| Plural   | aina       | ainan                     | ainar       |

The <span id="personal-pronouns">**personal pronouns**</span> are:

|              | Nominative | Accusative  | Genitive |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1. sg.       | ik         | mih         | mein     |
| 2. sg.       | þu         | þih         | þein     |
| 3. sg. masc. | he         | hem         | hes      |
| 3. sg. fem.  | se         | sem         | ses      |
| 3. sg. epic. | þai        | þaim / þait | þais     |
| 3. sg. refl. |            | sih         | sein     |
| 1. pl.       | we         | uns         | wor      |
| 2. pl.       | je         | juh         | jor      |
| 3. pl.       | þaia       | þain        | þair     |

The **possessive pronouns** in the nominative singular are:

|              | Nominative singular |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1. sg.       | min                 |
| 2. sg.       | þin                 |
| 3. sg. masc. | hes                 |
| 3. sg. fem.  | ses                 |
| 3. sg. epic. | þes                 |
| 3. sg. refl. | sin                 |
| 1. pl.       | wor                 |
| 2. pl.       | jor                 |
| 3. pl.       | þes                 |

For the accusative and plural forms, see [determiner paradigm][].

For example, the forms of _min_ include: _min, minam, minat, minas, mina, minan,
minar_.

Genitives usually follow another noun phrase. They can be interchangeable with
possesive nouns, but possessive nouns precede a noun phrase. The following are
interchangeable: _Min hund ann þinam kat_ = _Þe hund mein ann þem kat þein_ ("my
dog likes your cat").

The **negative quantifier**, works like Low Saxon "keen". It is inflected like
[_"en"_](#indefinite-article).

|          | Nominative | Accusative                | Genitive    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Singular | nen        | nem (nenam) / net (nenat) | nes (nenas) |
| Plural   | nena       | nenan                     | nenar       |

[negative indefinite pronoun]: #negative-indefinite-pronoun

The <span id="negative-indefinite-pronoun">**negative indefinite
pronoun**</span> is inflected like _"ain"_:

|          | Nominative | Accusative                    | Genitive      |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Singular | nain       | naim (nainam) / nait (nainat) | nais (nainas) |
| Plural   | naina      | nainan                        | nainar        |

Some adjectives can function as **quantifiers** and follow the [determiner
paradigm]. For example:

-   _all_ "all",
-   _mänig_ "many"
-   _sum_ "some"
-   _faw_ "few".

The **demonstrative pronouns** and **demonstrative articles** (identical) are:

|              | Nominative | Accusative             | Genitive |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| Proximal sg. | þis        | þit (þisam / þisat)    | þisas    |
| Proximal pl. | þisa       | þisan                  | þisar    |
| Medial sg.   | þas        | þat (þasam / þasat)    | þasas    |
| Medial pl.   | þasa       | þasan                  | þasar    |

Other pro-forms also known as **prepositional pro-forms** can be built with:

-   _hwem_ + preposition e.g. _hwem-miþ_ "with whom"
-   _hwat_ + preposition e.g. _hwat-þorh_ "by what means"
-   _hwar_ + preposition e.g. _hwar-in_ "wherein"
-   _hwan_ + preposition e.g. _hwan-um_ "around when"

## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut weak, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular
verbs.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Regular weak verbs have one stem.

Rückumlaut weak verbs have two stems: one for the present and one for the
preterite.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

**Pronoun dropping:** because some paradigms (preterite of all verbs, and
present of preterite-present verbs) have conflated forms for the 1st and 3rd
person, and sometimes the participle, the first or third person pronouns tend to
be explicitly marked when there is no context.

### Conjugation paradigms

#### Strong verbs

Strong verbs conjugate with ablaut and suffixes. There are 3 ablaut grades (1,
2, 3), and many ablaut classes.

The ablaut classes and their grades follow (example shows present infinitive,
past infinitive, past participle):

| Class    | 1   | 2   | 3   | Example                                     |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | ei  | ai  | i   | _streikon - straikon - strikon_ "to strike" |
| 2        | eu  | au  | u   | _fleugon - flaugon - flugon_ "to fly"       |
| 3-i, 4-i | i   | a   | u   | _bindon - bandon - bundon_ "to bind"        |
| 3-e, 4-e | e   | a   | o   | _helpon - halpon - holpon_ "to help"        |
| 5-e      | e   | a   | e   | _eton - aton - eton_ "to give"              |
| 5-i      | i   | a   | e   | _siton - saton - seton_ "to sit"            |

The conjugation paradigm for the indicative mood can be describe with one of the
ablaut grades and a suffix.

|            | Present  | Past    | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | 1 + -on  | 2 + -on |             |
| Participle | 1 + -ond | 3 + -on |             |
| 1st sg.    | 1 + -ew  | 2 + -   | 2 + e       |
| 2nd sg.    | 1 + -es  | 2 + -es | 2 + es      |
| 3rd sg.    | 1 + -et  | 2 + -   | 2 + e       |

| 3rd pl.    | 1 + -en  | 2 + -en | 2 + en      |

#### Regular weak verbs

Regular weak verbs can be distinguished according to their endings:

-   weak verbs infixed with -i- (often causative),
-   weak verbs infixed with -il- (often frequentative),
-   weak verbs infixed with -ir- (from words in -ir),
-   weak verbs infixed with -n- (often inchoative),
-   weak verbs infixed with -u- (other).

**Weak verbs with -i-** are usually causative in origin. Their paradigm:

|            | Present | Past  | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -ion    | -idon |             |
| Participle | -iond   | -iod  |             |
| 1st sg.    | -iew    | -ide  | -iaide      |
| 2nd sg.    | -ies    | -ides | -iaides     |
| 3rd sg.    | -iet    | -ide  | -iaide      |
| 1st pl.    | -iem    | -idem | -iaidem     |
| 2nd pl.    | -iej    | -idej | -iaidej     |
| 3rd pl.    | -ien    | -iden | -iden       |

Examples: _arväidion_ "to work", _füllion_ "to fill", _főlion_ "to feel".

**Weak verbs with -u-** are the default means of producing a verb from a noun.
Their paradigm:

|            | Present | Past  | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -uon    | -udon |             |
| Participle | -uond   | -uod  |             |
| 1st sg.    | -ueu    | -ude  | -uaide      |
| 2nd sg.    | -ues    | -udes | -uaides     |
| 3rd sg.    | -uet    | -ude  | -uaide      |
| 1st pl.    | -uem    | -udem | -uaidem     |
| 2nd pl.    | -uej    | -udej | -uaidej     |

**Weak verbs with -il-** are usually frequentative in origin. Their paradigm:

|            | Present | Past    | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -ilon   | -ildon  |             |
| Participle | -ilond  | -ilod   |             |
| 1st sg.    | -ilew   | -ilede  | -ilaide     |
| 2nd sg.    | -iles   | -iledes | -ilaides    |
| 3rd sg.    | -ilet   | -ilede  | -ilaide     |
| 1st pl.    | -ilem   | -ildem  | -ilaiem     |
| 2nd pl.    | -ilej   | -ildej  | -ilaiej     |
| 3rd pl.    | -ilen   | -ilden  | -ilaiden    |

Examples: _handilon_ "to handle, to negotiate", _bättilon_ (to beg).

**Weak verbs with -ir-** usually come from words ending in _-or_. Their
paradigm:

|            | Present | Past    | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -iron   | -irdon  |             |

| 2nd pl.    | -irej   | -iredej | -iraidej    |
| 3rd pl.    | -iren   | -ireden | -iraiden    |

Examples: _sikiron / sikron_ "to secure", _änþiron_ "to change".

**Weak verbs with -n-** usually come from words ending in _-on_. Their paradigm:

Example:

|            | Present | Past   | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -non    | -ndon  |             |

| 3rd pl.    | -nen    | -neden | -naine      |

Examples: _raudnon_ "to redden", _waknon_ "to awaken", _kwiknon_ (to make
lively).

#### Preterite-present verbs

This is a closed class of verbs. Often they have modal meanings.

See [reference](verbs-preterite-present.md);

Preterite-present (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -on     | -don |
| Participle | -ond    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -s      | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -em     | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -ej     | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -en     | -dun |

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

The rückumlaut weak paradigm (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -ion    | -den |
| Participle | -ind    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -iew    | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -ies    | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -iet    | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -iem    | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -iej    | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -ien    | -den |

### Preterite-present verbs

In the present, preterite-present verbs have different stems for singular and
plural conjugations. The present infinitive has the same stem as the plural
conjugations.

The preterite stem is the same for all preterite finite and non-finite forms.

Preterite-present verbs conjugate with these endings (dental suffix may be _d_
or _t_):

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./4-4-verbs-preterite-present.md).

### Irregular verbs

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./4-5-verbs-irregular.md).

### Verb periphrasis

Verb periphrasis can be done by putting two verbs together, head-last. Some
important constructions:

_skolun_ + infinitive: marks the future tense. E.g. _skal milkun þen kuw_ "I
shall milk the cow".

_skoldun_ + infinitive: marks the irrealis mood, or used as an infinitive for
future-in-past. E.g. _skolde a-wesen reik, als skolke a-häben ait reika fadar_
"I would be rich if I had a rich father".

_gán_ + infinitive: marks future tense, informal; also just marks that the
subject physically goes to do something. E.g. _gás etun butans_ "you're going to
eat ourside".

_wesun_ + past participle: marks a passive voice. E.g. _irs ew hwan hrópen te
hwiel þes málteidas!_ "you're always called during meals".

_werþun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a change in state.
Can be analysed as _werþun_ + adjective.

_bleibun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a continuation of
state. Can be analysed as _bleibun_ + adjective.

More constructions are of course possible, and their meanings may sometimes be
obvious e.g. _wollun_ + infinitive.

⚠️ Not sure if to make things head first or head last.

### Derivation

#### Causatives

A weak verb can be derived by changing the ablaut vowel, and in some cases,
Verner alternation. The meaning of the derived verb is usually causative, or
intransitive from a transitive verb.

| Strong ablaut | Weak causative   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| ei-ai-i       | ai               |
| eu-au-u       | au               |
| i-a-u         | ä                |
| e-a-o         | ä                |
| e-a-e         | ä                |
| i-a-i         | ä                |
| a-u-a         | ü                |
| a-i-a         |                  |
| á-é-á         | (Not productive) |
| ó-é-ó         | (Not productive) |

> ⚠️ Self-note: the sequence a-u-a should, by PGmc>Slumpisk sound changes, be
> a-ó-a. But I'm considering a-ó-a, a-ú-a, a-u-a.
>
> The problem with a-u-a is that it may create derivative words that class. The
> problem that a-ó-a is that causative verbs would have the stem vowel
> "ó-umlaut", whose representation as "eu" is ugly, and the representation as
> "ő" would create a letter only marginally used. Also, would it have the same
> sound value as "eu"?
>
> The problem with a-ú-a, is similar: it could create a need for a letter "ű"
> (but it wouldn't conflict with "eu"). However, hlaþan-hlúþan-hláþun (to load,
> intr.) creates hlűdian-hlűdid. It may conflict with a verb from "hlúd"
> (noiise).

The consonant alternations are:

-   þ > d
-   s > r
-   h > g

Examples include:

-   _leiþan_ (to undergo) > _läidian_ (to lead)
-   _beugan_ (to bend, intr.) > _bäugian_ (to bend sth.)
-   _drinkan_ (to drink) > _dränkian_ (to make drink)
-   _smertan_ (to hurt, intr.) > _smärtian_ (to cause pain)
-   _hladan_ (to accumulate) > _hlődian_ (to load sth. into sth.)
-   _fallan_ (to fall) > _fällian_ (to fell)

Because of their Proto-Germanic origin, the strong verb class is usually
distinguished by the main vowel and following semiconsonant or consonants, with
exceptions. These are the patterns:

| Class | Present | Past  | P. Part. | Next consonant   |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | e + i   | a + i | i        | any              |
| 2     | e + u   | a + u | u        | any              |
| 3-i   | i       | a     | u        | (m, n) + any     |
| 3-e   | e       | e     |          | (l, r) + any     |
| 4     | e       | a     | u        | m, n, l, r       |
| 5     | e       | a     | e        | not (m, n, l, r) |
| 6     | a       | u     | a        |                  |
| 7a    | a + i   | e + i | a + i    | any              |
| 7b    | a + u   | e + u | a + u    | any              |
| 7c-i  | a       | i     | a        | (m, n) + any     |
| 7c-e  | a       | e     | a        | (l, r) + any     |
| 7d    | á       | é     | á        | (any             |
| 7e-o  | o       | e     | o        | any              |
| 7e-ó  | ó       | é     | ó        | any              |

Note the parallel between the present and past of classes:

-   1 and 7a,
-   2 and 7b,
-   3-i and 7c-i,
-   3-e and 7c-e.

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person can be assumed.

This is the conjugation paradigm for a strong verb:

For _streikon_:

|             | Present       | Preterite    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Inifinitive | streik**on**  | straik**on** |
| Participle  | streik**ond** | strik**on**  |
| 1st. sg.    | streik**eg**  | straik       |
| 2nd. sg.    | streik**es**  | straik**es** |
| 3rd. sg.    | streik**et**  | straik       |
| 1st. pl.    | streik**em**  | straik**em** |
| 2nd. pl.    | streik**ej**  | straik**ej** |
| 3rd. pl.    | streik**en**  | straik**en** |

### Regular weak verbs

#### J-Verbs

These verbs usually have a causative origin (make someone or something do X), or
are derived from nouns ending in consonant + j.

For example, _senkion_ "to sink (transitive)", from _sinkon_ "to sink
(intransitive)":

|            | Preset   | Past     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Infinitive | senkion  | senkidon |
| Participle | senkiond | senkid   |
| 1st sg.    | senkieu  | senkide  |
| 2nd sg.    | senkies  | senkides |
| 3rd sg.    | senkiet  | senkide  |
| 1st pl.    | senkiem  | senkidem |
| 2nd pl.    | senkier  | senkider |
| 3rd pl.    | senkien  | senkiden |

#### W-Verbs

These verbs are the most productive class and can be made from e.g. nouns and
adjectives when not fitting other categories.

For example, _makuon_ (to make):

|            | Preset  | Past    |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Infinitive | makuon  | makudon |
| Participle | makuond | makud   |
| 1st sg.    | makueu  | makude  |
| 2nd sg.    | makues  | makudes |
| 3rd sg.    | makuet  | makude  |
| 1st pl.    | makuem  | makudem |
| 2nd pl.    | makuer  | makuder |
| 3rd pl.    | makuen  | makuden |

#### L-Verbs

These verbs usually have a frequentative origin.

For example _handlon_ (to handle):

|            | Preset   | Past      |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | handlon  | handlodon |
| Participle | handlond | handlod   |
| 1st sg.    | handleu  | handlode  |
| 2nd sg.    | handles  | handlodes |
| 3rd sg.    | handlet  | handlode  |
| 1st pl.    | handlem  | handlodem |
| 2nd pl.    | handler  | handloder |
| 3rd pl.    | handlen  | handloden |

#### N-Verbs

These verbs usually have an inchoative meaning (start to be X) and are made by
suffixing adjectives.

For example _raudnon_ "to redden":

|            | Preset   | Past      |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | raudnon  | raudnodon |
| Participle | raudnond | raudnod   |
| 1st sg.    | raudneu  | raudnode  |
| 2nd sg.    | raudnes  | raudnodes |
| 3rd sg.    | raudnet  | raudnode  |
| 1st pl.    | raudnem  | raudnodem |
| 2nd pl.    | raudner  | raudnoder |
| 3rd pl.    | raudnen  | raudnoden |

## Numbers

| Number | Cardinal          | Ordinal        |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 1      | ain               | fórist, airist |
| 2      | twai              | twaid, anþor   |

| 11     | ailif             | ailifoþ        |
| 12     | twalif            | twalifoþ       |
| 13     | þirtein           |                |
| 14     | feurtein          |                |
| 15     | fimftein          |                |
| 16     | sehstein          |                |
| 17     | sebontein         |                |
| 18     | ahtein            |                |
| 19     | neuntein          |                |
| 20     | twaintig          |                |
| 21     | twaintig-ond-ain  |                |
| 22     | twaintig-ond-twai |                |
| 23     | twaintig-ond-þir  |                |
| 24     | twaintig-ond-feur |                |
| 30     | þirtig            |                |
| 40     | feurtig           |                |
| 50     | fimftig           |                |
| 100    | hunderd           |                |
| 1000   | þusend            |                |

Ordinal numbers start with _airist_ or _fórist_ (meaning "earliest" or "most in
front"). All other ordinals are constructed with the cardinal and _-id_. Thus:
_twaiid, þirid, feurid, fimfid_ etc.

Numerals for 1 and 2 are the only irregular and may behave like a determiner:

| Number | Nom. | Acc. | Gen.  |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1      | ain  | ait  | ais   |
| 2      | twai | two  | twair |

Multiples are constructed with _-fald_, thus _twaifald_ is "double" and
_seffald_ "seven times" or "sevenfold". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-ainfald" (twenty-one-fold).

Fractions are constructed with _-dail_, _þridail_ is "a third" and "fimfdail" is
"a fifth". The exception is _halv_, meaning "half". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-aindail".

## Prepositions

When a preposition preceds (or follows) a noun phrase, the noun phrase is in the
nominative case, unless it is a pronoun, in which case it is followed by the
accusative.

This is a list of prepositions and words derived from them.

Unless specified, prepositions are followed by the accusative case when they
have a complement.

Prepositions and advebs of place:

| Locative Prep. | Ablative Prep. | Allative Prep. | Locative Adv.      | Allative Adv. | Ablative | Adjective      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------- | -------------- |

## Conjunctions

Basic conjunctions

| Word | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| und  | "and"   |
| or   | "or"    |

The simplest subordinating conjunction is _at_, mostly equivalent to english
"that". E.g.

-   _Þänkeo at skolen onnon þen kokueda laukan þein._ "I think that they will
    like your cooked leeks."

Interrogative (hw-) pronouns and pro-adverbs also to coordinate phrases. For
example:

-   _Þe feld hwar þe skáp at þet gras._ "The field where the sheep at the
    grass."
-   _Þe mánoþ hwan blómai farskeinen._ "The month when the flowers appear."

Conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction _at_. Some examples are:

-   för, för at: reason
-   üm, üm at: intention
-   aftir, aftir at: after
-   fór, fór at: before

## Sentence building

Positive yes-no questions can be built by starting the question with a verb
followed by _ne_. Example:

-   Etes ne þen krabban? _Do you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _ja_ or _ne_.

Negative yes-no questions can be built by start the question with the negated
verb followed by _jah_.

-   Ne etes jah þen krabban? _Don't you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _jah_ or _neh_.

Clauses can also be joined by pronouns, which take the case of the referent in
the subordinate clause. For example:

-   Þe hund hwe blaffet ilke dag is mein. _The dog which barks ever day is
    mine._
-   Þe hund hwem sah was brún. _The dog which I saw is brown._
-   Þe hund, hwes aiganor singet ilke morgin, is hail frijendleik. _The dog,
    whose owner sings ever morning, is friendly._
