## Orthography and phonology

### Vowels

| Ortography | Pronunciation |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| i          | /…™/           |
| u          | / ä/           |
| e          | /…õ/           |
| o          | /…î/           |
| a          | /a/           |
| √º          | / è/           |
| √∂          | /≈ì/           |
| √§          | /…õ/           |
| √∫          | /uÀê/          |
| √≥          | /oÀê/          |
| √©          | /eÀê/          |
| √°          | /aÀê/          |
| ≈ë          | /√∏Àê/          |
| ei         | /iÀê/          |
| eu         | /yÀê/          |
| ai         | /…õÀê/          |
| au         | /…îÀê/          |

### Consonants

Consonants come in (up to) three variants: plain, w-variant, j-variant.

In the following table:

-   (I) means "in initial position".
-   (M) means "in medial position between sonorants".
-   (F) means "in final position or before a consonant".
-   Unmarked pronunciations mean "otherwise".

| Plain | Pronunciation           |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| p     | /p/                     |
| b     | /b/, /v/ (M), /f/ (F)   |
| t     | /t/                     |
| d     | /d/                     |
| k     | /k/                     |
| g     | /g/, /…£/ (M), /x~√ß/ (F) |
| f     | /f/                     |
| √æ     | /Œ∏/                     |
| s     | /s/                     |
| h     | /h/, /x~√ß/ (F)          |
| l     | /l/                     |
| r     | /r/                     |
| m     | /m/                     |
| n     | /n/, /≈ã/ before velars  |
| j     | /j/                     |
| w     | /w/                     |

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at internal boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

Notes:

‚ü®b‚ü© can be realised as /b/ everywhere, but is recommended to be realised as:

-   /b/ initially,
-   /bÀê/ when written ‚ü®bb‚ü©
-   /v/ medially between sonorants,
-   /f/ medially otherwise and finally.

E.g. ‚ü®b√©r‚ü© /b…õÀêr/ "bear", ‚ü®halb‚ü© /half/ "half".

‚ü®g‚ü© can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

-   /g/ initially,
-   /gÀê/ when written ‚ü®gg‚ü©
-   /…£/ medially between sonorants,
-   /x/ medially otherwise and finally.

Note: "sk" allows "dialectal variation" as /sx/ or / É/, and optionally only
before "i" and "e". üí≠üí≠üí≠ Maybe it should be spelled ‚ü®sc‚ü©.

What happens with geminated consonants at the word-end. üí≠üí≠üí≠ Maybe they
trigger minor tone changes, like Swedish tonemes.

## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and determiners decline for number and case. There
are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive.

Nouns, and adjectives have strong and weak paradigms. The weak paradigm is
almost always used, and a determiner is obligatory.

The strong noun paradigm is used when a determiner is left out, but should be
used only for literary purposes.

The strong adjective paradigm is used when a noun is implicit (e.g. "the strong
(one)").

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form.

Word order is relatively free, but V2 order is preferred as in Norwegian. Verb
compounding is preferred to be head-final, but head-initial is allowed for
literary or emphatic purposes. Irregular adjectives have irregular comparative
and superlative forms.

They all inflect regularly with case and number.

| Root | Comparative | Superlative | Meaning         |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| g√≥d  | b√§tir       | b√§st        | "good"          |
| √ºbil | wirsir      | wirist      | "bad"           |
| -    | mindir      | mindist     | "less", "least" |
| -    | mair        | maist       | "many", "most"  |

Root forms meaning "little, few" and "many" are the following. They have regular
comparatives and superlatives that are synonymous with the ones above.

-   "few": _faw, wainag_.
-   "many": _fil, manag_.

## Nominal paradigms

All noun phrases must be "complete". A noun phrase is complete when:

-   (a) it has a determiner,
-   (b) or has no determiner but an strongly declined noun,
-   (c) or has no determiner but a strongly declined adjective without a noun
    (e.g. _√æe rauda_ "the red one"),
-   (d) or is a pronoun.

In most cases, the number and case of a complete noun phrase is always noun.

In case (a), a noun is strongly

**Nouns** decline for number and case. There are weak and strong paradigms.

The **weak noun paradigm**:

|           | Singular | Plural |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom.-Acc. | -        | -an    |
| Gen.      | -as      | -ar    |

The **strong noun paradigm** is used in literary contexts and when a determiner
is dropped; it is:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -         | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

Regular nouns take no ending in the nominative singular; nouns from adjectives
(with an implicit noun e.g. the red one, the tall one) have the _-a_ ending.

There is an animacy distinction in the strong accusative singular: _-am_ for
animate and _-at_ for inanimate.

The **weak adjective paradigm** is used when a noun is preceded by a determiner:

|           | All numbers |
| --------- | ----------- |
| All cases | -a          |

The **strong adjective paradigm** is used when the noun is omitted:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -a        | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

### General notes

Distal pronouns are also used for referent, as in, "such person", "such thing",
"such kind", etc.

In the following tables, any **base form** and **irregular forms** are marked
with **bold**. Regular forms take endings from the strong noun paradigm (with
the inanimate ending).

Some determiners and pronouns have a animacy distinction in the singular
accusative, _-am_ or _-ar_. This distinction can be between personhood and
nonpersonhood, or animate and inanimate, according to context and preference.

### Personal pronouns

|      | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc. | 3rd sg epi. | 3rd fem. | 1st pl. | 2nd pl. | 3rd pl. | 3rd refl. |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Nom. | ik      | √æu      | he            | √æ√©          | se       | we      | je      | √æ√°a     |           |
| Acc. | mih     | √æih     | hem           | √æ√©m/√æ√©t     | sem      | uns     | juh     | √æ√©n     | sih       |
| Gen. | mein    | √æein    | hes           | √æ√©s         | ses      | unsar   | jewar   | √æ√©r     | sein      |

w There is an animacy distinction in the 3rd person epicine singular pronoun.
The diacritic on the 3rd persons is only an ortographic convention to
distinguish it from the definite article.

As with the genitive of nouns, genitive pronouns ("possessives") follow the noun
they modify. They do not inflect. For example: _√æe kat mien_ "my cat".

### Determiners

Determiners fully denote case and number; therefore they accompany
weakly-inflected nouns.

They are any of:

-   definite and indefinite articles,
-   demonstratives,
-   quantifiers,
-   numerals.

### Definite and indefinite articles and pronouns

The definite articles and definite pronoun are the same:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | √æe        | √æea    |
| Acc. | √æem / √æet | √æen    |
| Gen. | √æes       | √æer    |

Note that the singular forms are the same as the 3rd person epicine pronouns.
There is only a subtle distinction betwen the definite pronouns and the 3rd
person pronouns. The definite pronouns tend to mean "the aforementioned". This
distinction is not important.

The indefinite article and indefinite pronouns:

|      | Singular    | Plural |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **en**      | ena    |
| Acc. | **em / et** | enan   |
| Gen. | **es**      | enar   |

Should I distinguish the definite article and pronoun‚ùì The article could look
like an unstressed form: _en, et, enas, enai, einan, enar_.

### Quantifiers

The negative quantifier, both article and pronoun, works like HG "kein" or
NL/NDS "keen", and follows the declension paradigm of _en_:

|      | Singular      | Plural |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **nen**       | nena   |
| Acc. | **nem / net** | nenan  |
| Gen. | **nes**       | nenar  |

Most other quantifiers have this declension paradigm:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -         | -a     |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -as       | -ar    |

Some examples of quantifiers that follow that paradigm are: _alla_ "all",
_manga_ "many", _suma_ "some", _fawa_ "few".

### Demonstratives

The demonstrative pronouns are identical to demonstrative articles

|      | Proximal sg. | „ÄÉ pl. | Medial sg. | „ÄÉ pl. | Distal sg. | „ÄÉ pl. |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **√æis**      | √æisai  | **√æas**    | √æasai  | **jain**   | jainai |
| Acc. | **√æit**      | √æisan  | **√æat**    | √æasan  | **jait**   | jainan |
| Gen. | √æisas        | √æisar  | √æasas      | √æasar  | jainas     | jainar |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

### Option or category

The words _hwelk_ "which, what kind", _hjelk_ "this one", _√æelk_ "that one",
_sjelk_ "such one" are both determiners and pronouns.

They are inflected similarly, as strong nouns:

|      | Question sg.  | „ÄÉ pl.  | Proximal sg.  | „ÄÉ pl.  | Medial sg.   | „ÄÉ pl. | Distal sg.    | „ÄÉ pl.  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Nom. | **hwelk**     | hwelkai | **hjelk**     | hjelkai | **√æelk**     | √æelkai | **sjelk**     | sjelkai |
| Acc. | hwelkam / -at | hwelkan | hjelkam / -at | hjelkan | √æelkam / -at | √æelkan | sjelkam / -at | sjelkan |
| Gen. | hwelkan       | hwelkar | hjelkan       | hjelkar | √æelkan       | √æelkar | sjelkan       | sjelkar |

### Pro-person and pro-thing

The pro-person complement personal pronouns; they are _hwe_ "who", _hje_ "this
person(s)", _√æje_ "that person(s)", _sje_ "such person(s)". They do not inflect
in number. The existential pro-person means "someone", and the negative
pro-person means "no one".

The pro-thing pronoun is similar to pro-persons. It only exists in a _hw-_ form.

Pro-person:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | „ÄÉ pl. | Negative  |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Nom. | **hwe**  | **hains**  | hainai | **naims** |
| Acc. | **hwem** | **hain**   | hainan | **naim**  |
| Gen. | **hwes** | hainas     | hainar | naimas    |

Pro-thing:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | „ÄÉ pl. | Negative |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Nom. | **hwa**  | **ihs**    | ihsai  | **nihs** |
| Acc. | **hwat** | **iht**    | ihsan  | **niht** |
| Gen. | **hwas** | ihsas      | ihsar  | nihsas   |

### Pro-adverbs

|                     | Question | Proximal | Medial | Comparative | Existential | Neg. Existential | Universal |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Time                | hwan     | hjan     | √æan    | sjan        | erg hwan    | nerg hwan        | ew hwan   |
| Start (Time)        | hwens    | hjens    | √æens   | sjens       | erg hwens   | nerg hwens       | ew hwens  |
| End (Time)          | hwiner   | hjiner   | √æiner  | sjiner      | erg hwiner  | nerg hwiner      | ew hwiner |
| Place               | hwar     | hjar     | √æar    | sjar        | erg hwar    | nerg hwar        | ew hwar   |
| Origin (Place)      | hwers    | hjers    | √æers   | sjers       | erg hwers   | nerg hwers       | ew hwers  |
| Destination (Place) | hwi√æer   | hji√æer   | √æi√æer  | sji√æer      | erg hwi√æer  | nerg hwi√æer      | ew hwi√æer |
| Manner              | hwus     | hjus     | √æus    | sjus        | erg hwus    | nerg hwus        | ew hwus   |

The time adverbs' meanings are: when, now, then, such moment, sometime, never,
always.

The start-of-time adverbs' meanings are: whence, since now, thence, since such
moment, since sometime, since never, always (emphasis on a fact that has always
been true).

The end-of-time adverbs' meanings are: until when, until now, until then, until
such moment, until sometime; _nerg hwiner_ and _ew hwiner_ may not have a
practical definition but could be used by analogy.

The place adverbs' meanings are: where, here, there, such place, somewhere,
nowhere, everywhere.

The start (place) adverbs' meanings are: wherefrom, herefrom, therefrom, from
such place, from somewhere, from nowhere, from everywhere.

The end (place) adverbs' meanings are: whereto, thereto, thereto, to such place,
to somewhere, to nowhere, to everywhere.

The adverbs of manner's meanings are: how, in this way, in that way, in such
way, somehow, in no way, in every way.

Note that many determiners are similar to related pronouns, but differ in the
vowel.

‚ö†Ô∏è Should make a family of pro-adverbs for "why" and "what for".

### Other

Other pro-forms can be built combining pro-persons, pro-things, and pro-adverbs
with prepositions. Pro-persons and pro-things inflect according to the case
governed by the preposition.

‚ö†Ô∏è Example needed.

## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, r√ºckumlaut weak, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular
verbs.

All infinitives are prefixed with _a-_, spelled with a dash.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Regular weak verbs have one stem.

R√ºckumlaut weak verbs have two stems: one for the present and one for the
preterite.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

### Pronoun dropping

**Pronoun dropping:** because all past paradigms, and the present paradigm of
preterite-present verbs have conflated forms for the 1st and 3rd person, and
sometimes the participle, the first or third person pronouns tend to be
explicitly marked where there is no context (in all past paradigms, and the
present paradigm of preterite present verbs).

### Conjugation paradigms

### Strong verbs

Strong verbs follow an ablaut pattern. There are several ablaut patterns:

| Class | Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | ei                 | ai              | i               |
| 2     | eu                 | au              | u               |
| 34-e  | e                  | a               | o               |
| 34-i  | i                  | a               | u               |
| 5-e   | e                  | a               | e               |
| 5-i   | i                  | a               | e               |
| 6e    | a                  | u               | a               |
| 6a    | e                  | u               | a               |
| 7a    | ai                 | ei              | ai              |
| 7b    | au                 | eu              | au              |
| 7c-e  | a                  | e               | a               |
| 7c-i  | a                  | i               | a               |
| 7d    | √°                  | √©               | √°               |
| 7e-o  | o                  | e               | o               |
| 7e-√≥  | √≥                  | √©               | √≥               |

Here are some examples; each verb is provided in present and past infinitive,
and past participle:

-   _streikan-straikan-strikun_ (to strike),
-   _fleugan-flaugan-flugun_ (to fly),
-   _helpan-halpan-holpun_ (to help),
-   _bindan-bandan-bundun_ (to bind).
-   _geban-gaban-gebun_ (to give),
-   _sitan-satan-setun_ (to sit),
-   _faran-furan-farun_ (to travel),
-   _swaran-swuran-swaran_ (to swear),
-   _haitan-heitan-haitun_ (to be named),
-   _hlaupan-hleupan-hlaupun_ (to walk),
-   _fallan-fellan-fallun_ (to fall),
-   _fangan-fingan-fagun_ (to grasp),
-   _l√°tan-l√©tan-l√°tun_ (to let),
-   _hr√≥pan-hr√©pan-hr√≥pun_ (to call).

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

### Weak verbs

Regular weak verbs can be distinguished according to their endings:

-   weak verbs ending in _-ion_ (causative),
-   weak verbs ending in _-ilon_ (frequentative),
-   weak verbs ending in _-non_ (inchoative),
-   weak verbs ending in _-uon_ (other).

### R√ºckumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./4-3-verbs-r√ºckumlaut.md).

### Preterite-present verbs

In the present, preterite-present verbs have different stems for singular and
plural conjugations. The present infinitive has the same stem as the plural
conjugations.

The preterite stem is the same for all preterite finite and non-finite forms.

Preterite-present verbs conjugate with these endings (dental suffix may be _d_
or _t_):

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./4-4-verbs-preterite-present.md).

### Irregular verbs

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./4-5-verbs-irregular.md).

### Verb periphrasis

Verb periphrasis can be done by putting two verbs together, head-last. Some
important constructions:

_skolun_ + infinitive: marks the future tense. E.g. _skal milkun √æen kuw_ "I
shall milk the cow".

_skoldun_ + infinitive: marks the irrealis mood, or used as an infinitive for
future-in-past. E.g. _skolde a-wesen reik, als skolke a-h√§ben ait reika fadar_
"I would be rich if I had a rich father".

_g√°n_ + infinitive: marks future tense, informal; also just marks that the
subject physically goes to do something. E.g. _g√°s etun butans_ "you're going to
eat ourside".

_wesun_ + past participle: marks a passive voice. E.g. _irs ew hwan hr√≥pen te
hwiel √æes m√°lteidas!_ "you're always called during meals".

_wer√æun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a change in state.
Can be analysed as _wer√æun_ + adjective.

_bleibun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a continuation of
state. Can be analysed as _bleibun_ + adjective.

More constructions are of course possible, and their meanings may sometimes be
obvious e.g. _wollun_ + infinitive.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not sure if to make things head first or head last.

### Derivation

#### Causatives

A weak verb can be derived by changing the ablaut vowel, and in some cases,
Verner alternation. The meaning of the derived verb is usually causative, or
intransitive from a transitive verb.

| Strong ablaut | Weak causative   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| ei-ai-i       | ai               |
| eu-au-u       | au               |
| i-a-u         | √§                |
| e-a-o         | √§                |
| e-a-e         | √§                |
| i-a-i         | √§                |
| a-u-a         | √º                |
| a-i-a         |                  |
| √°-√©-√°         | (Not productive) |
| √≥-√©-√≥         | (Not productive) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Self-note: the sequence a-u-a should, by PGmc>Slumpisk sound changes, be
> a-√≥-a. But I'm considering a-√≥-a, a-√∫-a, a-u-a.
>
> The problem with a-u-a is that it may create derivative words that class. The
> problem that a-√≥-a is that causative verbs would have the stem vowel
> "√≥-umlaut", whose representation as "eu" is ugly, and the representation as
> "≈ë" would create a letter only marginally used. Also, would it have the same
> sound value as "eu"?
>
> The problem with a-√∫-a, is similar: it could create a need for a letter "≈±"
> (but it wouldn't conflict with "eu"). However, hla√æan-hl√∫√æan-hl√°√æun (to load,
> intr.) creates hl≈±dian-hl≈±did. It may conflict with a verb from "hl√∫d"
> (noiise).

The consonant alternations are:

-   √æ > d
-   s > r
-   h > g

Examples include:

-   _lei√æan_ (to undergo) > _l√§idian_ (to lead)
-   _beugan_ (to bend, intr.) > _b√§ugian_ (to bend sth.)
-   _drinkan_ (to drink) > _dr√§nkian_ (to make drink)
-   _smertan_ (to hurt, intr.) > _sm√§rtian_ (to cause pain)
-   _hladan_ (to accumulate) > _hl≈ëdian_ (to load sth. into sth.)
-   _fallan_ (to fall) > _f√§llian_ (to fell)

#### Prefixes

-   **f√≥r**: before
-   **after**: after
-   **fer**: start to
-   **fir**: wrong
-   **or**:
-   **in**: in

### TO DO

### Regular strong verbs

Strong verbs follow an ablaut pattern. There are several ablaut patterns:

| Class    | Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1        | ei                 | ai              | i               |
| 2        | eu                 | au              | u               |
| 3,4-e    | e                  | a               | o               |
| 3,4-i    | i                  | a               | u               |
| 5e       | e                  | a               | e               |
| 5i       | i                  | a               | i               |
| 6a       | a                  | u               | a               |
| 6e (irr) | e                  | u               | a               |
| 7a       | ai                 | ei              | ai              |
| 7b       | au                 | eu              | au              |
| 7c-e     | a                  | e               | a               |
| 7c-i     | a                  | i               | a               |
| 7d       | √°                  | √©               | √°               |
| 7e-o     | o                  | e               | o               |
| 7e-√≥     | √≥                  | √©               | √≥               |

Here are some examples; each verb is provided in present and past infinitive,
and past participle:

| Class | Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle | Meaning      |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 1     | streikon           | straikon        | strikon         | to strike    |

| 3-i   | drinkon            | drankon         | drunkon         | to drink     |
| 3-e   | helpon             | halpon          | holpon          | to help      |
| 4     | nemon              | namon           | nomon           | to take      |

| 7c-i  | fangon             | fingon          | fangon          | to grab      |
| 7c-e  | fallon             | fellon          | fallon          | to fall      |
| 7d    | l√°ton              | l√©ton           | l√°ton           | to let       |
| 7e-o  | hr√≥pon             | hr√©pon          | hr√≥pon          | to call      |
| 7e-√≥  | growon             | grewon          | growon          | to grow      |

The past infinitive could also be called "perfect infinitive" e.g. "to have
done".

Because of their Proto-Germanic origin, the strong verb class is usually
distinguished by the main vowel and following semiconsonant or consonants, with
exceptions. These are the patterns:

| Class | Present | Past  | P. Part. | Next consonant   |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | e + i   | a + i | i        | any              |
| 2     | e + u   | a + u | u        | any              |
| 3-i   | i       | a     | u        | (m, n) + any     |
| 3-e   | e       | e     |          | (l, r) + any     |
| 4     | e       | a     | u        | m, n, l, r       |
| 5     | e       | a     | e        | not (m, n, l, r) |
| 6     | a       | u     | a        |                  |
| 7a    | a + i   | e + i | a + i    | any              |
| 7b    | a + u   | e + u | a + u    | any              |
| 7c-i  | a       | i     | a        | (m, n) + any     |
| 7c-e  | a       | e     | a        | (l, r) + any     |
| 7d    | √°       | √©     | √°        | (any             |
| 7e-o  | o       | e     | o        | any              |
| 7e-√≥  | √≥       | √©     | √≥        | any              |

Note the parallel between the present and past of classes:

-   1 and 7a,
-   2 and 7b,
-   3-i and 7c-i,
-   3-e and 7c-e.

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person can be assumed.

This is the conjugation paradigm for a strong verb:

For _streikon_:

|             | Present       | Preterite    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Inifinitive | streik**on**  | straik**on** |
| Participle  | streik**ond** | strik**on**  |
| 1st. sg.    | streik**eg**  | straik       |
| 2nd. sg.    | streik**es**  | straik**es** |
| 3rd. sg.    | streik**et**  | straik       |
| 1st. pl.    | streik**em**  | straik**em** |
| 2nd. pl.    | streik**ej**  | straik**ej** |
| 3rd. pl.    | streik**en**  | straik**en** |

### Regular weak verbs

#### J-Verbs

These verbs usually have a causative origin (make someone or something do X), or
are derived from nouns ending in consonant + j.

For example, _senkion_ "to sink (transitive)", from _sinkon_ "to sink
(intransitive)":

|            | Preset   | Past     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Infinitive | senkion  | senkidon |
| Participle | senkiond | senkid   |
| 1st sg.    | senkieu  | senkide  |
| 2nd sg.    | senkies  | senkides |
| 3rd sg.    | senkiet  | senkide  |
| 1st pl.    | senkiem  | senkidem |
| 2nd pl.    | senkier  | senkider |
| 3rd pl.    | senkien  | senkiden |

#### W-Verbs

These verbs are the most productive class and can be made from e.g. nouns and
adjectives when not fitting other categories.

For example, _makuon_ (to make):

|            | Preset  | Past    |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Infinitive | makuon  | makudon |
| Participle | makuond | makud   |
| 1st sg.    | makueu  | makude  |
| 2nd sg.    | makues  | makudes |
| 3rd sg.    | makuet  | makude  |
| 1st pl.    | makuem  | makudem |
| 2nd pl.    | makuer  | makuder |
| 3rd pl.    | makuen  | makuden |

#### L-Verbs

These verbs usually have a frequentative origin.

For example _handlon_ (to handle):

|            | Preset   | Past      |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | handlon  | handlodon |
| Participle | handlond | handlod   |
| 1st sg.    | handleu  | handlode  |
| 2nd sg.    | handles  | handlodes |
| 3rd sg.    | handlet  | handlode  |
| 1st pl.    | handlem  | handlodem |
| 2nd pl.    | handler  | handloder |
| 3rd pl.    | handlen  | handloden |

### N-Verbs

These verbs usually have an inchoative meaning (start to be X) and are made by
suffixing adjectives.

For example _raudnon_ "to redden":

|            | Preset   | Past      |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | raudnon  | raudnodon |
| Participle | raudnond | raudnod   |
| 1st sg.    | raudneu  | raudnode  |
| 2nd sg.    | raudnes  | raudnodes |
| 3rd sg.    | raudnet  | raudnode  |
| 1st pl.    | raudnem  | raudnodem |
| 2nd pl.    | raudner  | raudnoder |
| 3rd pl.    | raudnen  | raudnoden |

Ordinal numbers start with _airist_ or _f√≥rist_ (meaning "earliest" or "most in
front"). All other ordinals are constructed with the cardinal and _-id_. Thus:
_twaiid, √æirid, feurid, fimfid_ etc.

Numerals for 1 and 2 are the only irregular and may behave like a determiner:

| Number | Nom. | Acc. | Gen.  |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1      | ain  | ait  | ais   |
| 2      | twai | two  | twair |

Multiples are constructed with _-fald_, thus _twaifald_ is "double" and
_seffald_ "seven times" or "sevenfold". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-ainfald" (twenty-one-fold).

Fractions are constructed with _-dail_, _√æridail_ is "a third" and "fimfdail" is
"a fifth". The exception is _halv_, meaning "half". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-aindail".

## Prepositions

When a preposition preceds (or follows) a noun phrase, the noun phrase is in the
nominative case, unless it is a pronoun, in which case it is followed by the
accusative.

This is a list of prepositions and words derived from them.

Unless specified, prepositions are followed by the accusative case when they
have a complement.

Pairs of prepositions:

-   um (around), √ºm (for the sake of, with the intention to)
-   for (for), f√∂r (because of)

## Conjunctions

Basic conjunctions

| Word | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| und  | "and"   |
| or   | "or"    |

The simplest subordinating conjunction is _at_, mostly equivalent to english
"that". E.g.

-   _√û√§nkeo at skolen onnon √æen kokueda laukan √æein._ "I think that they will
    like your cooked leeks."

Interrogative (hw-) pronouns and pro-adverbs also to coordinate phrases. For
example:

-   _√ûe feld hwar √æe sk√°p at √æet gras._ "The field where the sheep at the
    grass."
-   _√ûe m√°no√æ hwan bl√≥mai farskeinen._ "The month when the flowers appear."

Conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction _at_. Some examples are:

-   f√∂r, f√∂r at: reason
-   √ºm, √ºm at: intention
-   aftir, aftir at: after
-   f√≥r, f√≥r at: before

## Sentence building

Positive yes-no questions can be built by starting the question with a verb
followed by _ne_. Example:

-   Etes ne √æen krabban? _Do you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _ja_ or _ne_.

Negative yes-no questions can be built by start the question with the negated
verb followed by _jah_.

-   Ne etes jah √æen krabban? _Don't you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _jah_ or _neh_.

Clauses can also be joined by pronouns, which take the case of the referent in
the subordinate clause. For example:

-   √ûe hund hwe blaffet ilke dag is mein. _The dog which barks ever day is
    mine._
-   √ûe hund hwem sah was br√∫n. _The dog which I saw is brown._
-   √ûe hund, hwes aiganor singet ilke morgin, is hail frijendleik. _The dog,
    whose owner sings ever morning, is friendly._

Stems of the 3rd and 4th strong verb classes tend to follow either the ablaut
sequences i-a-u or e-a-o.

The basic rule for derivation from PGmc lemmas is: endings (az, ≈ç, etc.)
disappear.

_z_ becomes _r_ in all positions.

_u > o_ tend to happen before liquids _l, r_ and before geminates.

The overlong ending _√¥_ tends to make the previous syllable long, unless:

-   it is already long,
-   it is followed by sonorants _m, n, l, r_.

Geminates:

-   _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr, jj, ww_ tend to (add high-pitch
    tone?) sxdg

The following medial clusters appear in medial position in PGmc., need special
handling in Conlang1 due to suffix-deletion. The letters _≈è, ≈è_ represent
letters that only appear in unsuffixed lexemes.
