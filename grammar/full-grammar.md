## Orthography and phonology

### Vowels

| Ortography | Pronunciation |

| i          | /ɪ/           |
| u          | /ʊ/           |

### Consonants

| Plain | Pronunciation           |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| p     | /p/                     |
| b     | /b/, /v/ (M), /f/ (F)   |
| t     | /t/                     |
| d     | /d/                     |
| k     | /k/                     |
| g     | /g/, /ɣ/ (M), /x~ç/ (F) |
| f     | /f/                     |
| þ     | /θ/                     |
| s     | /s/                     |
| h     | /h/, /x~ç/ (F)          |
| l     | /l/                     |
| r     | /r/                     |
| m     | /m/                     |
| n     | /n/, /ŋ/ before velars  |
| j     | /j/                     |
| w     | /w/                     |

The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at word boundaries in composite words.

These consonants can be geminate: _pp, tt, kk, ss, bb, dd, gg, mm, nn, ll, rr,
jj, ww_

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

- /g/ initially,
- /gː/ when written ⟨gg⟩
- /ɣ/ medially between sonorants,
- /x/ medially otherwise and finally.

## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, and determiners decline for number, case, animacy.

There are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive. Animacy (animate, inanimate) is only relevant in singular
accusative declensions.

Nouns have strong and weak paradigms.

- The weak paradigm is used with a determiner.
- The strong noun paradigm is used when a determiner is left out.

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form. Otherwise they have three
declension paradigms.

- When preceding a noun, adjectives decline with a weak paradigm (e.g. _þe
  rauda apol_ "the red apple").
- Some adjectives can work as function as determiners, and when so, decline as
  determiners (e.g. _þe fawa aplan_ "the few apples").
- When an adjective takes the places of a noun, it declines with a strong
  paradigm (e.g. _þe rauda_ "the red ones").

Most adjectives have comparative and superlative forms.

Verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, and mood.

- There are three persons, and two numbers (singular and plural).
- The moods are: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative.
- Non-composite tenses are: present, preterite (both in the indicative). Many
  composite forms are possible.
- Non-finite forms include: infinitive, past infinitive, present participle,
  past participle.

There are two main regular verb systems: weak and strong. There are irregular
verbs.

V2 order is preferred when the verb is not the first word in a sentence. Finite
verb sequences prefer to be head initial e.g. _Skölde willon eton_ "I/he/she
should want to eat".

Adjectives usually precede nouns.

Adverbs usually precede verbs, but can also follow them. The adverb _ne_ (not)
can only appear before, not after.

## Nouns and adjectives

All noun phrases must be "complete". A noun phrase is complete when:

- it has a determiner,
- or has no determiner but a strongly declined noun,
- or has no determiner but a strongly declined adjective without a noun,
- or is a pronoun.

The most basic nouns and adjectives consist of a **root** and an optional **ending**; this is called, the **stem**. Endings include _-il, -ol, -on, or, -ow_ The stem may change after receiving a suffix when inflected according to the next rules.

- If a root ends in a single and non-geminate consonant, the vowel of the ending disappears e.g. _fingor > fingran_ "finger > fingers", _arhow > arhwan_ "arrow > arrows".
- If the root ends in a geminate consonant in the unmarked form, it loses gemination, and the vowel of the ending disappears e.g. _sparrow > sparwan_ "sparrow > sparrows", _gellow > gelwa_ "yellow (predicative) > yellow (attributive)", _appol > aplan_ "apple > apples", _farrow > farwan_ (colour > colours).

In the reference tables to follow, the acccusative singular suffix is _-am_ for the animate,
and _-at_ for the inanimate.

The **weak noun paradigm**:

|          | Nominative & Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Singular | -                       | -as      |
| Plural   | -an                     | -ar      |

[strong noun paradigm]: #strong-noun-paradigm

The <span id="strong-noun-paradigm">**strong noun paradigm**</span>:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -          | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -ai        | -an        | -ar      |

The **weak adjective paradigm**:

|             | All cases |
| ----------- | --------- |
| All numbers | -a        |

The **strong adjective paradigm**:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |

| Singular | -a         | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -anna      | -an        | -ar      |

[determiner paradigm]: #determiner-paradigm

The <span id="determiner-paradigm">**determiner paradigm**</span>:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -          | -am / -at  | -as      |
| Plural   | -a         | -an        | -ar      |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

## Determiners and pronouns

Determiners fully denote case and number; therefore they accompany
weakly-inflected nouns.

They are any of:

- definite and indefinite articles,
- demonstratives,
- quantifiers,
- numerals.

The **definite articles** are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | þe         | þem / þet  | þes      |
| Plural   | þea        | þen        | þer      |

The **definite pronouns** are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative  | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Singular | þai        | þaim / þait | þais     |
| Plural   | þaia       | þain        | þair     |

The definite pronouns also appear under "personal pronouns".

The <span id="indefinite-article">**indefinite articles**</span> are:

|          | Nominative | Accusative            | Genitive  |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| Singular | en         | em (enam) / et (enat) | es (enas) |
| Plural   | ena        | enan                  | enar      |

[indefinite pronoun]: #indefinite-pronoun

The <span id="indefinite-pronoun">**indefinite pronoun**</span> is:

|          | Nominative | Accusative                | Genitive    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Singular | ain        | aim (ainam) / ait (ainat) | ais (ainas) |
| Plural   | aina       | ainan                     | ainar       |

The <span id="personal-pronouns">**personal pronouns**</span> are:

|              | Nominative | Accusative  | Genitive |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1. sg.       | ik         | mih         | mein     |
| 2. sg.       | þu         | þih         | þein     |
| 3. sg. masc. | he         | hem         | hes      |
| 3. sg. fem.  | se         | sem         | ses      |
| 3. sg. epic. | þai        | þaim / þait | þais     |
| 3. sg. refl. |            | sih         | sein     |
| 1. pl.       | we         | uns         | wor      |
| 2. pl.       | je         | juh         | jor      |
| 3. pl.       | þaia       | þain        | þair     |

The **possessive pronouns** in the nominative singular are:

|              | Nominative singular |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1. sg.       | min                 |
| 2. sg.       | þin                 |
| 3. sg. masc. | hes                 |
| 3. sg. fem.  | ses                 |
| 3. sg. epic. | þes                 |
| 3. sg. refl. | sin                 |
| 1. pl.       | wor                 |
| 2. pl.       | jor                 |
| 3. pl.       | þair                |

For the accusative and plural forms, see [determiner paradigm][].

For example, the forms of _min_ include: _min, minam, minat, minas, mina, minan,
minar_.

Genitives usually follow another noun phrase. They can be interchangeable with
possesive nouns, but possessive nouns precede a noun phrase. The following are
interchangeable: _Min hund ann þinam kat_ = _Þe hund mein ann þem kat þein_ ("my
dog likes your cat").

The **negative quantifier**, works like Low Saxon "keen". It is inflected like
[_"en"_](#indefinite-article).

|          | Nominative | Accusative                | Genitive    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Singular | nen        | nem (nenam) / net (nenat) | nes (nenas) |
| Plural   | nena       | nenan                     | nenar       |

[negative indefinite pronoun]: #negative-indefinite-pronoun

The <span id="negative-indefinite-pronoun">**negative indefinite
pronoun**</span> is inflected like _"ain"_:

|          | Nominative | Accusative                    | Genitive      |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Singular | nain       | naim (nainam) / nait (nainat) | nais (nainas) |
| Plural   | naina      | nainan                        | nainar        |

Some adjectives can function as **quantifiers** and follow the [determiner
paradigm]. For example:

- _all_ "all",
- _mänig_ "many"
- _sum_ "some"
- _faw_ "few".

The **demonstrative pronouns** and **demonstrative articles** (identical) are:

|              | Nominative | Accusative                    | Genitive |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Proximal sg. | þis        | þim (þisam) / þit (þisat)     | þisas    |
| Proximal pl. | þisa       | þisan                         | þisar    |
| Medial sg.   | þas        | þam (þasam) / þat (þasat)     | þasas    |

| Distal pl.   | jaina      | jainan                        | jainar   |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

The **pro-class** _hwelk_ and its family can be determiners or pronouns
and decline with the [determiner paradigm][] or [strong noun paradigm][] accordingly..

Other pro-forms also known as **prepositional pro-forms** can be built with pro-forms in the accusative followed by prepositions. For example:

- _hwem-miþ_ "with whom"
- _hwat-þorh_ "by what means"
- _hwar-in_ "wherein"
- _hwan-um_ "around when"

## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut weak, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular
verbs.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Regular weak verbs have one stem.

Rückumlaut weak verbs have two stems: one for the present and one for the
preterite.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

**Pronoun dropping:** because some paradigms (preterite of all verbs, and
present of preterite-present verbs) have conflated forms for the 1st and 3rd
person, and sometimes the participle, the first or third person pronouns tend to
be explicitly marked when there is no context.

### Conjugation paradigms

#### Strong verbs

Strong verbs conjugate with ablaut and suffixes. There are 3 ablaut grades (1,
2, 3), and many ablaut classes.

The ablaut classes and their grades follow (example shows present infinitive,
past infinitive, past participle):

| Class    | 1   | 2   | 3   | Example                                     |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | ei  | ai  | i   | _streikon - straikon - strikon_ "to strike" |
| 2        | eu  | au  | u   | _fleugon - flaugon - flugon_ "to fly"       |

ablaut grades and a suffix.

|            | Present  | Past    | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | 1 + -on  | 2 + -on |             |
| Participle | 1 + -ond | 3 + -on |             |
| 1st sg.    | 1 + -ew  | 2 + -   | 2 + e       |
| 2nd sg.    | 1 + -es  | 2 + -es | 2 + es      |
| 3rd sg.    | 1 + -et  | 2 + -   | 2 + e       |

#### Regular weak verbs

Regular weak verbs can be distinguished according to their endings:

- weak verbs infixed with -i- (often causative),
- weak verbs infixed with -il- (often frequentative),
- weak verbs infixed with -ir- (from words in -ir),
- weak verbs infixed with -n- (often inchoative),
- weak verbs infixed with -u- (other).

**Weak verbs with -i-** are usually causative in origin. Their paradigm:

|            | Present | Past  | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -ion    | -idon |             |
| Participle | -iond   | -iod  |             |
| 1st sg.    | -iew    | -ide  | -iaide      |
| 2nd sg.    | -ies    | -ides | -iaides     |
| 3rd sg.    | -ieþ    | -ide  | -iaide      |
| 1st pl.    | -iem    | -idem | -iaidem     |
| 2nd pl.    | -iej    | -idej | -iaidej     |

Their paradigm:

|            | Present | Past  | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -uon    | -udon |             |
| Participle | -uond   | -uod  |             |
| 1st sg.    | -ueu    | -ude  | -uaide      |
| 2nd sg.    | -ues    | -udes | -uaides     |
| 3rd sg.    | -ueþ    | -ude  | -uaide      |
| 1st pl.    | -uem    | -udem | -uaidem     |

| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -ilon   | -ildon  |             |
| Participle | -ilond  | -ilod   |             |
| 1st sg.    | -ilew   | -ilede  | -ilaide     |
| 2nd sg.    | -iles   | -iledes | -ilaides    |
| 3rd sg.    | -ileþ   | -ilede  | -ilaide     |
| 1st pl.    | -ilem   | -ildem  | -ilaiem     |
| 2nd pl.    | -ilej   | -ildej  | -ilaiej     |
| 3rd pl.    | -ilen   | -ilden  | -ilaiden    |

Examples: _handilon_ "to handle, to negotiate", _bättilon_ (to beg).

**Weak verbs with -ir-** usually come from words ending in _-or_. Their
paradigm:

|            | Present | Past    | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -iron   | -irdon  |             |

| 3rd pl.    | -iren   | -ireden | -iraiden    |

Examples: _sikron / sikron_ "to secure", _anþron_ "to change".

**Weak verbs with -n-** usually come from words ending in _-on_. Their paradigm:

Example:

|            | Present | Past   | Subjunctive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Infinitive | -non    | -ndon  |             |

| 2nd pl.    | -nej    | -nedej | -naideje    |
| 3rd pl.    | -nen    | -neden | -naine      |

Examples: _raudnon_ "to redden", _waknon_ "to awaken", _kwiknon_ (to make
lively).

#### Preterite-present verbs

This is a closed class of verbs. Often they have modal meanings.

See [reference](verbs-preterite-present.md);

Preterite-present (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -on     | -don |
| Participle | -ond    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -s      | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -em     | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -ej     | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -en     | -dun |

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

#### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

The rückumlaut weak paradigm (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -ion    | -den |
| Participle | -ind    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -iew    | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -ies    | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -ieþ    | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -iem    | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -iej    | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -ien    | -den |

#### Irregular verbs

For a complete list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./4-5-verbs-irregular.md).

### Tenses and moods

Some combinations of tense and mood can only be done by verb periphrasis.

Verb periphrasis can be done by putting two verbs together, head-last. Some
important constructions:

_skolun_ + infinitive: marks the future tense. E.g. _skal milkun þen kuw_ "I
shall milk the cow".

_skoldun_ + infinitive: marks the irrealis mood, or used as an infinitive for
future-in-past. E.g. _skolde a-wesen reik, als skolke a-häben ait reika fadar_
"I would be rich if I had a rich father".

_gán_ + infinitive: marks future tense, informal; also just marks that the
subject physically goes to do something. E.g. _gás etun butans_ "you're going to
eat ourside".

_wesun_ + past participle: marks a passive voice. E.g. _irs ew hwan hrópen te
hwiel þes málteidas!_ "you're always called during meals".

_werþun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a change in state.
Can be analysed as _werþun_ + adjective.

_bleibun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a continuation of
state. Can be analysed as _bleibun_ + adjective.

More constructions are of course possible, and their meanings may sometimes be
obvious e.g. _wollun_ + infinitive.

⚠️ Not sure if to make things head first or head last.

## Numbers

| Number | Cardinal          | Ordinal        |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 1      | ain               | fórist, airist |

| 5      | fimf              | fimfoþ         |
| 6      | sehs              | sehsoþ         |
| 7      | sebon             | sebunoþ        |
| 8      | aht               | ahtoþ          |

| 12     | twalif            | twalifoþ       |
| 13     | þirtein           |                |
| 14     | feurtein          |                |
| 15     | fimftein          |                |
| 16     | sehstein          |                |
| 17     | sebontein         |                |
| 18     | ahtein            |                |
| 19     | neuntein          |                |
| 20     | twaintig          |                |
| 21     | twaintig-ond-ain  |                |
| 22     | twaintig-ond-twai |                |
| 23     | twaintig-ond-þir  |                |
| 24     | twaintig-ond-feur |                |
| 30     | þirtig            |                |
| 40     | feurtig           |                |
| 50     | fimftig           |                |
| 100    | hunderd           |                |
| 1000   | þusend            |                |

Ordinal numbers start with _airist_ or _fórist_ (meaning "earliest" or "most in
front"). All other ordinals are constructed with the cardinal and _-id_. Thus:
_twaiid, þirid, feurid, fimfid_ etc.

Numerals for 1 and 2 are the only irregular and may behave like a determiner:

| Number | Nom. | Acc. | Gen.  |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1      | ain  | ait  | ais   |
| 2      | twai | two  | twair |

Multiples are constructed with _-fald_, thus _twaifald_ is "double" and
_seffald_ "seven times" or "sevenfold". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-ainfald" (twenty-one-fold).

Fractions are constructed with _-dail_, _þridail_ is "a third" and "fimfdail" is
"a fifth". The exception is _halv_, meaning "half". Composite numbers look like
"twaintig-und-aindail".

## Prepositions

A preposition governs these cases:

- with a pronoun, the accusative,
- otherwise (i.e. nouns), the nominative.

When a preposition preceds (or follows) a noun phrase, the noun phrase is in the
nominative case, unless it is a pronoun, in which case it is followed by the
accusative.

This is a list of prepositions and words derived from them.

Unless specified, prepositions are followed by the accusative case when they
have a complement.

Prepositions and advebs of place:

| Locative Prep. | Ablative Prep. | Allative Prep. | Locative Adv.      | Allative Adv. | Ablative | Adjective      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| in (inside of) |                | inn (into)     | innin, binnin      | enn           | in af    | innir (innira) |
|                | ur             | ut (out to)    | utin, butin        | utir          | ut af    | utir (utra)    |
| uf (on)        |                | up (onto)      | ovin, bovin        | ovir          | up af    | upir (upra)    |
| undir          |                | undir          | undin, bundin      | undir         |          | undir (undra)  |
| niþir          |                |                | niþin, biniþin     | niþir         |          | undir (undra)  |
| twiskin        |                | twiskir        | twiskin, bitwiskin | twiskir       |          |                |
| fór            |                |                | forin              | for           |          |                |
| um             |                |                |                    |               |          |                |
| aftir          |                |                | aftin              | aftir         |          | aftir (aftra)  |
| þorhw          |                |                |                    |               |          |                |
| gigin          |                |                |                    |               |          |                |

Pairs of prepositions:

- um (around), üm (for the sake of, with the intention to)
- for (for), för (because of)

## Conjunctions

Basic coordinating conjunctions include: _and_ "and", _or_ "or".

The simplest subordinating conjunction is _at_, mostly equivalent to english
"that". E.g.

- _Þänkew at skolen onnon þen kokueda laukan þein._ "I think that they will
  like your cooked leeks."

Some conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction _at_. This can also be analyzed as a case where the argument of the preposition is not a noun phrase, but a verb phrase. Some examples are:

- _för_ "for"
  - as preposition e.g. _þis is för þen fiskan_ "this is for the fish"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þis is för at fangon fiskan_ "this is for catching fish"
- _üm_ "due to, because"
  - as preposition e.g. _þe hund kwam in üm þunor_ "the dog came in because of the thunder"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þe hund kwam in üm at is bang gigin þunran_ "the dog came in because it's scared of thunders"
- _aftir_ "after"
  - as preposition e.g. _þe wikk skal kwemon aftir þet folla mán_ "the wizard shall come after the full moon"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þe wikk skal kwemon after at þe mán is foll_ "the wizard shall come after the moon is full"

| Preposition   | Conjunction          |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| för "for"     | för at "in order to" |
| üm "due to"   | üm at "because"      |
| aftir "after" | aftir at "after"     |
| fór "before"  | fór "before"         |

## Sentence building

### Questions

Positive yes-no questions can be built by starting the question with a verb
followed by _ne_. Example:

- Etes ne krabban? _Do you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _ja_ or _ne_.

Negative yes-no questions can be built by start the question with the negated
verb followed by _jah_.

- Ne etes jah krabban? _Don't you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _jah_ or _neh_.

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses have the same word order as main clauses; the V2 rule is observed.

They can be introduced by relative pronouns and other pro-forms, which look like the interrogative forms (hwe, hwa, etc.). In the case of pronouns, they take the case of the referent in the subordinate clause. Prepositional pronouns and pro-forms also introduce relative clauses. For example:

- _Þe hund hwe blaffet ilke dag is mein._ "The dog which barks ever day is
  mine."
- _Þe hund hwem sah was brún._ "The dog which I saw is brown."
- _Þe hund, hwes aiganor singet ilke morgin, is hail frijendleik._ "The dog,
  whose owner sings ever morning, is friendly."
- _Þe feld hwar þe skáp at þet gras._ "The field where the sheep at the
  grass."
- _Þe mánoþ hwan blómai förskeinen._ "The month when the flowers appear."
- _Þaht at willes eton þet_ "I thought that you wanted to eat it."

Naturally they can also be introduced by conjunctions derived from prepositions. For example:

-
