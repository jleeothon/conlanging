The grammatical class of words with bound suffixes can usually be guessed by the
vowel in (bound) suffix:

- **a** is the usual vowel for adjectives (agreement), nouns, determiners,
- **e** is the usual vowel for verbs,
- **i** is the usual vowel for adjectives and adverbs (comparative and
  superlative degrees, and adverbialisation),
- **u** may appear within roots of nouns and adjectives due to euphony or fusion
  of very old PGmc affixes.

Noun suffixes:

- Verb + iling - agent suffix
- Verb + il - tool
- Verb + ung - general noun from verb
- Adj + nis - state of being, giwarniss
- Adj + haid - state of being
- Adj + skap - shape or condition of
- Adj + iþ - amount of e.g. langiþ
