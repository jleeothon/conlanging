## Nouns and adjectives

All noun phrases must be "complete". A noun phrase is complete when:

- it has a determiner,
- or has no determiner but a strongly declined noun,
- or has no determiner but a strongly declined adjective without a noun,
- or is a pronoun.

The most basic nouns and adjectives consist of a **root** and an optional **ending**; this is called, the **stem**. Endings include _-il, -ol, -on, or, -ow_ The stem may change after receiving a suffix when inflected according to the next rules.

- If a root ends in a single and non-geminate consonant, the vowel of the ending disappears e.g. _fingor > fingran_ "finger > fingers", _arhow > arhwan_ "arrow > arrows".
- If the root ends in a geminate consonant in the unmarked form, it loses gemination, and the vowel of the ending disappears e.g. _sparrow > sparwan_ "sparrow > sparrows", _gellow > gelwa_ "yellow (predicative) > yellow (attributive)", _appol > aplan_ "apple > apples", _farrow > farwan_ (colour > colours).

In the reference tables to follow, the acccusative singular suffix is _-am_ for the animate,
and _-at_ for the inanimate.
