## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut weak, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular
verbs.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Regular weak verbs have one stem.

Rückumlaut weak verbs have two stems: one for the present and one for the
preterite.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

**Pronoun dropping:** because some paradigms (preterite of all verbs, and
present of preterite-present verbs) have conflated forms for the 1st and 3rd
person, and sometimes the participle, the first or third person pronouns tend to
be explicitly marked when there is no context.

### Conjugation paradigms

#### Preterite-present verbs

See [reference](verbs-preterite-present.md);

Preterite-present (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -on     | -don |
| Participle | -ond    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -es     | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -       | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -em     | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -ej     | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -en     | -dun |

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

#### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

The rückumlaut weak paradigm (may have -t- affix instead of -d-):

|            | Present | Past |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Infinitive | -ion    | -den |
| Participle | -ind    | -d   |
| 1st sg.    | -iew    | -de  |
| 2nd sg.    | -ies    | -des |
| 3rd sg.    | -ieþ    | -de  |
| 1st pl.    | -iem    | -dem |
| 2nd pl.    | -iej    | -dej |
| 3rd pl.    | -ien    | -den |

#### Irregular verbs

For a complete list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./4-5-verbs-irregular.md).

### The conjunctive mood

Conditional mood is form by skoldon + infinitive (skoldon is the past infinitive of skolon).

### Subjunctive mood

Some verbs have a dedicated subjunctive form.

Strong verbs have a subjunctive conjugation.

### Periphrastic forms

Some combinations of tense and mood can only be done by verb periphrasis.

Verb periphrasis can be done by putting two verbs together with a preferred order head-last.

#### Future

_skolun_ + infinitive

E.g. _skal milkon þen kuw_ "I shall milk the cow".

**_gán_ + infinitive** Also marks the future, but is more informal. Can also indicate literal movement.

For example:

- _gáu leson et bók_ "I'm going to read a book"
- _gás eton butins_ "you're going to eat ourside"

#### Conditional

_skoldun_ + infinitive: marks the irrealis mood, or used as an infinitive for
future-in-past. E.g. _skolde weson reik, als skolke häbon ait reika fadar_
"I would be rich if I had a rich father".

#### Passive voice

_wesun_ + past participle: marks a passive voice. E.g. _irs ew hwan hrópen te
hwiel þes málteidas!_ "you're always called during meals".

_werþun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a change in state.
Can be analysed as _werþun_ + adjective.

_bleibun_ + past participle: marks passive voice, and marks a continuation of
state. Can be analysed as _bleibun_ + adjective.
