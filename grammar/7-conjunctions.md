## Conjunctions

Basic coordinating conjunctions include: _and_ "and", _or_ "or".

The simplest subordinating conjunction is _at_, mostly equivalent to english
"that". E.g.

- _Þänkę at skolen onnon þen kokueda laukan þein._ "I think that they will
  like your cooked leeks."

Some conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction _at_. This can also be analyzed as a case where the argument of the preposition is not a noun phrase, but a verb phrase. Some examples are:

- _för_ "for"
  - as preposition e.g. _þis is för þen fiskan_ "this is for the fish"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þis is för at fangon fiskan_ "this is for catching fish"
- _üm_ "due to, because"
  - as preposition e.g. _þe hund kwam in üm þunor_ "the dog came in because of the thunder"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þe hund kwam in üm at is bang gigin þunran_ "the dog came in because it's scared of thunders"
- _aftir_ "after"
  - as preposition e.g. _þe wikk skal kwemon aftir þet folla mán_ "the wizard shall come after the full moon"
  - as conjunction e.g. _þe wikk skal kwemon after at þe mán is foll_ "the wizard shall come after the moon is full"

| Preposition   | Conjunction          |

| för "for"     | för at "in order to" |
| üm "due to"   | üm at "because"      |
| aftir "after" | aftir at "after"     |
| fór "before"  | fór "before"         |
