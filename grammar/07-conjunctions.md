## Conjunctions

Basic conjunctions

| Word | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| und  | "and"   |
| or   | "or"    |

Interrogative (hw-) pronouns and pro-adverbs also to coordinate phrases. For
example:

- Þe feld hwar þe skáp at þet gras. _The field where the sheep at the grass._
- Þe mánoþ hwan blómai farskeinen. _The month when the flowers appear._

The default subordinating conjunction is "at". For example:

- Þänkeu at sehes gód ut. _I think you look good._

Conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction. Some examples are:

| Word          | Meaning               |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| te hwiel hwat | while (from _during_) |
| te end hwat   | until                 |
