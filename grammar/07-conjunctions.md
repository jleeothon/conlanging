## Conjunctions

Basic conjunctions

| Word | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| und  | "and"   |
| or   | "or"    |

The simplest subordinating conjunction is _at_, mostly equivalent to english
"that". E.g.

-   _Þänkeo at skolen onnon þen kokueda laukan þein._ "I think that they will
    like your cooked leeks."

Interrogative (hw-) pronouns and pro-adverbs also to coordinate phrases. For
example:

-   _Þe feld hwar þe skáp at þet gras._ "The field where the sheep at the
    grass."
-   _Þe mánoþ hwan blómai farskeinen._ "The month when the flowers appear."

Conjunctions can be derived from prepositions by following with the
subordinating conjunction _at_. Some examples are:

-   för, för at: reason
-   üm, üm at: intention
-   aftir, aftir at: after
-   fór, fór at: before
