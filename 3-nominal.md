## Nominal paradigms

**Nouns** decline for number and case. There are weak and strong paradigms.

The **weak noun paradigm** requires a determiner; it is:

|           | Singular | Plural |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom.-Acc. | -        | -an    |
| Gen.      | -as      | -ar    |

The **weak adjective** ending for all cases and numbers is: _-a_.

The **strong noun paradigm** is used in literary contexts and when a determiner
is dropped; it is:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -         | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

There is an animacy distinction in the accusative singular: _-am_ for animate
and _-at_ for inanimate.

The **strong adjective paradigm** is used in literary contexts and when the noun
is omitted:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -a        | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

### General notes

Distal pronouns are also used for referent, as in, "such person", "such thing",
"such kind", etc. 🤷‍♂️ Maybe this is a bad idea.

In the following tables, any **base form** and **irregular forms** are marked
with **bold**. Regular forms take endings from the strong noun paradigm (with
the inanimate ending).

Some determiners and pronouns have a animacy distinction in the singular
accusative, _-am_ or _-ar_. This distinction can be between personhood and
nonpersonhood, or animate and inanimate, according to context and preference.

### Personal pronouns

|      | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc. | 3rd sg epi. | 3rd fem. | 1st pl. | 2nd pl. | 3rd pl. | 3rd refl. |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Nom. | ik      | þu      | he            | þe          | se       | we      | je      | þej     |           |
| Acc. | mih     | þih     | hem           | þem/þet     | sem      | uns     | jew     | þejem   | sih       |
| Gen. | mein    | þein    | hes           | þes         | ses      | unser   | jewer   | þejer   | sein      |

There is an optional animacy distinction in the 3rd person epicine singular
pronoun.

As with nouns, genitive/possesive pronouns follow the noun they modify. They do
not inflect. For example: _þe kat mien_ "my cat".

### Determiners

Determiners fully denote case and number; therefore they accompany
weakly-inflected nouns.

They are any of:

- definite and indefinite articles,
- demonstratives,
- quantifiers

### Definite and indefinite articles and pronouns

The definite articles and definite pronoun are the same:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | þe        | þei    |
| Acc. | þem / þet | þen    |
| Gen. | þes       | þer    |

Note that the singular forms are the same as the 3rd person epicine pronouns.
There is only a subtle distinction betwen the definite pronouns and the 3rd
person pronouns. The definite pronouns tend to mean "the aforementioned". This
distinction is not important.

The indefinite article and indefinite pronouns:

|      | Singular | Plural |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **ain**  | ainai  |
| Acc. | **ait**  | ainan  |
| Gen. | ainas    | ainar  |

Should I distinguish the definite article and pronoun❓ The article could look
like an unstressed form: _en, et, enas, enai, einan, enar_.

### Quantifiers

The negative quantifier, both article and pronoun, works like Low Saxon "keen":

|      | Singular | Plural |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **nain** | nainai |
| Acc. | **nait** | nainan |
| Gen. | nainas   | nainar |

The universal quantifier, both article and pronoun:

|      | Singular | Plural |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **all**  | allai  |
| Acc. | **alt**  | allan  |
| Gen. | allas    | allar  |

🤷‍♂️ _alt_ doesn't look convincing.

Other adjectives may act as quantifiers if they are strongly inflected e.g.
_sum_ "some", without a formal or literary register.

### Demonstratives

The demonstrative pronouns are identical to demonstrative articles

|      | Proximal sg. | 〃 pl. | Medial sg. | 〃 pl. | Distal sg. | 〃 pl. |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **þis**      | þisai  | **þas**    | þasai  | **jain**   | jainai |
| Acc. | **þit**      | þisan  | **þat**    | þasan  | **jait**   | jainan |
| Gen. | þisas        | þisar  | þasas      | þasar  | jainas     | jainar |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

### Option or category

The words _hwelk_ "which, what kind", _hjelk_ "this one", _þelk_ "that one",
_sjelk_ "such one" are both determiners and pronouns.

They are inflected similarly, as strong nouns:

|      | Question sg.  | 〃 pl.  | Proximal sg.  | 〃 pl.  | Medial sg.   | 〃 pl. | Distal sg.    | 〃 pl.  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Nom. | **hwelk**     | hwelkai | **hjelk**     | hjelkai | **þelk**     | þelkai | **sjelk**     | sjelkai |
| Acc. | hwelkam / -at | hwelkan | hjelkam / -at | hjelkan | þelkam / -at | þelkan | sjelkam / -at | sjelkan |
| Gen. | hwelkan       | hwelkar | hjelkan       | hjelkar | þelkan       | þelkar | sjelkan       | sjelkar |

### Pro-person and Pro-thing

The pro-person complement personal pronouns; they are _hwe_ "who", _hje_ "this
person(s)", _þje_ "that person(s)", _sje_ "such person(s)". They do not inflect
in number. The existential pro-person means "someone", and the negative
pro-person means "no one".

The pro-thing pronoun is similar to pro-persons. It only exists in a _hw-_ form.

Pro-person:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | 〃 pl.  | Negative |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| Nom. | hwe      | man?       | main?   | njem     |
| Acc. | hwem     | manam?     | mainan? | njemam   |
| Gen. | hwes     | manas?     | mainar? | njemas   |

Pro-thing:

|      | Question | Exist. sg. | 〃 pl. | Negative |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Nom. | hwa      | ihs        | ihsai  | nihs     |
| Acc. | hwat     | iht        | ihsan  | niht     |
| Gen. | hwas     | ihsas      | ihsar  | nihtas   |

Thing (what, something, nothing, etc):

|                        | Nominative | Accusative | Plural |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Question               | hwa        | hwat       | hwas   |
| Existential sg.        | ihs        | iht        | ihsas  |
| Existential pl.        | ihse       | ihsan      | ihsar  |
| Elective (anything)    | erg ihs    | …          | …      |
| Negative (nothing)     | nihs       | niht       | nihsas |
| Universal (everything) | alls       | allt       | allas  |

Pro-adverbs:

|                     | Question | Proximal | Medial | Comparative | Existential | Neg. Existential | Universal |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Time                | hwan     | hjan     | þan    | sjan        | erg hwan    | nerg hwan        | ew hwan   |
| Start (Time)        | hwens    | hjens    | þens   | sjens       | erg hwens   | nerg hwens       | ew hwens  |
| End (Time)          | hwiner   | hjiner   | þiner  | sjiner      | erg hwiner  | nerg hwiner      | ew hwiner |
| Place               | hwar     | hjar     | þar    | sjar        | erg hwar    | nerg hwar        | ew hwar   |
| Origin (Place)      | hwers    | hjers    | þers   | sjers       | erg hwers   | nerg hwers       | ew hwers  |
| Destination (Place) | hwiþer   | hjiþer   | þiþer  | sjiþer      | erg hwiþer  | nerg hwiþer      | ew hwiþer |
| Manner              | hwus     | hjus     | þus    | sjus        | erg hwus    | nerg hwus        | ew hwus   |

The time adverbs' meanings are: when, now, then, such moment, sometime, never,
always.

The start-of-time adverbs' meanings are: whence, since now, thence, since such
moment, since sometime, since never, always (emphasis on a fact that has always
been true).

The end-of-time adverbs' meanings are: until when, until now, until then, until
such moment, until sometime; _nerg hwinl_ and _ew hwinl_ may not have a
practical definition but could be used by analogy.

Self-note: _hwinl_ doesn't sound too convincing. It originates from "hwan +
til".

The place adverbs' meanings are: where, here, there, such place, somewhere,
nowhere, everywhere.

The start (place) adverbs' meanings are: wherefrom, herefrom, therefrom, from
such place, from somewhere, from nowhere, from everywhere.

The end (place) adverbs' meanings are: whereto, thereto, thereto, to such place,
to somewhere, to nowhere, to everywhere.

The adverbs of manner's meanings are: how, in this way, in that way, in such
way, somehow, in no way, in every way.

Note that many determiners are similar to related pronouns, but differ in the
vowel.
